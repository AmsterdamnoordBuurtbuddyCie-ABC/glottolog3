     'comment': u'retired in 2008 on request by Ian Tupper\n\n\u201cAn SIL-PNG survey (Kassell, MacKenzie and Potter 2005) found the three proposed languages were distinct from each other, using both lexicostatistical and intelligibility testing. Average lexical similarity of the three speech varieties is between 39% and 58%, as measured with a 170-item standard word list. The accepted threshold for regarding speech varieties as dialects of a single language is 70% lexical similarity (SIL 1991); these scores are well below that threshold. Testing of intelligibility found that speakers of each variety had 13 - 56% comprehension of recorded texts in the other varieties. SIL guidelines give a recorded text test score of 75% as the lowest acceptable indicator of comprehension; again these scores are well below that threshold. The survey team concluded that Andai, Nanubae and Tapei should be considered three distinct languages.\u201d'},

     'comment': u'retired in 2008 on request by David Howard\n\n\u201cSarasira and Sukurum were formerly listed as dialects of Adzera. However, even though they are closer geographically to Adzera villages, historically and linguistically they are more closely related to the Mari and Wampur languages, and are thus in a different subfamily of the Upper Markham language family to Adzera. Susanne Holzknecht has documented the linguistic differences in: Holzknecht, Susanne. 1989. The Markham Languages of Papua New Guinea. Pacific Linguistics C-115. Canberra: Australian National University. Her work provides sufficient proof that these speech varieties are indeed separate languages that belong in the Mountain subgroup of Upper Markham languages, rather than being included as dialects of Adzera. Malcolm Ross also treats these three languages as distinct languages of the Upper Markham subfamily in his 1986 Ph.D. dissertation, later published as: Ross, Malcolm D. 1988.

     'comment': u'retired in 2008 on request by David Mead \n\n\u201cIn 1908, the Dutch administrator O. E. Goedhart visited Batui. In a somewhat odd-seeming practice today, he named the people\u2019s speech the \u2018Baha language\u2019 after their negative term. In this he was partly in error, because the word for \u2018no\u2019 in Batui is actually mbaha\u2019. In 1914, the Dutch linguist N. Adriani further compounded the error by surmising that Baha must be a dialect of the nearby Pamona language. Adriani\'s basis was (a) geographical proximity, and (b) that the negative term "baha" superficially resembled "bare\'e" of the Pamona language.\nSadly, no one bothered to check things out further. Instead, as the years passed, the claim was repeated on language atlases and other writings about Sulawesi languages. People forgot about the shaky foundation upon which it had been built, and thus error had become "linguistic fact".\nIn 2006 we collected (in fact, became the first to collect) first-hand information on the Batui language, and discovered that Batui is not even closely related to Pamona at all, but shares its greatest affinities with the Saluan-Banggai languages to the east. Including Batui (or Baha) as a dialect of Pamona was nothing other than an egregious error.\u201d'},

     'comment': u"retired in 2008 on request by Conrad Hurd\n\nHmong Njua [blu] should be retired, split into Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao, Small Flowery Miao, Horned Miao and Hmong Njua. Until now Hmong Njua [blu] as described in the Ethnologue 15th ed. was awkwardly forced to encompass a large number of Chuanqiandian Miao lects. The specific variety Hmong Njua (or Hmongb Nzhuab), appearing under country headings for Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar and also spoken by many overseas Hmong around the world, is one member of the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao group. Thus Hmong Njua has been used in two senses until now, denoting a broad category of several dozen Chuanqiandian lects, and in a much narrower sense, denoting one specific variety within that broad category. Because from now on it would be unclear in any given use of the identifier as to whether [blu] meant the old, overly broad Hmong Njua, or the new, more proper Hmong Njua, the identifier [blu] must be retired from use. The specific variety Hmong Njua should be given a new identifier to remove that ambiguity, and the broad category of Chuanqiandian lects should be split into four new entries.\nChinese linguists normally organize the broad category of Chuanqiandian lects, formerly represented in the Ethnologue by the lect best known overseas, Hmong Njua, into three or\nfour clusters of closely related lects. They call these three clusters \u5ddd\u9ed4\u6ec7\u65b9\u8a00\u5ddd\u9ed4\u6ec7\u6b21\u65b9 \u8a00\u7b2c\u4e00\u3001\u7b2c\u4e8c\u3001\u7b2c\u4e09\u3001\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u571f\u8bed. In English these could be translated as the first, second,\nthird and fourth local dialects of the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect of the Chuanqiandian dialect of the Miao language.\nChinese linguists have arranged these multiple varieties in three or four groups based on closeness of genetic relationship, determined through analysis of extensive word lists, and on estimates of inherent intelligibility, gained through observations of ability to communicate across lects in the mother tongue.\nWhile the many lects within the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao group (corresponding to the first local dialect described by Chinese linguists) do differ somewhat in phonology and lexicon, and their speakers have autonyms, clothing and customs distinct from other subgroups within the cluster, and while marriage tends to be within the same subgroup, there is fairly good inherent intelligibility at a functional level across lects within the cluster.\nSmall Flowery Miao or Gha-Mu, corresponding to the second local dialect described by Chinese linguists, is a distinct ethnolinguistic subgroup with its own clear identity. Through historical reconstruction Chinese linguists have determined that the Small Flowery Miao lect is closely related to other lects within the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect, and they state that there is partial intelligibility between this lect and Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao (the first local dialect).\nSinicized Miao or Hmong Sa, posited by at least one Chinese linguist (Li Yunbing) as a fourth local dialect of the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect, is also a distinct ethnolinguistic sub- group, and is phonologically more divergent from the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao lects (the first local dialect) than Small Flowery Miao is from the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao lects. There is marginal intelligibility between Sinicized Miao and either Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao lects or Small Flowery Miao. It is believed, however, that this is the same language that is already represented by the code [hmz] Hmong Shua, previously identified as only being used in Vietnam. Thus, this proposal recommends an expansion of the denotation of [hmz] Hmong Shua to incorporate this lect as spoken in China (cf change request 2007-132)\nHorned Miao, although it has been classified in several different ways by Chinese linguists, is also a distinct ethnolinguistic sub-group speaking a variety of Miao that is phonologically divergent from other lects in the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect and only partially intelligible with them.\nThe specific variety Hmong Njua (or Hmongb Nzhuab), spoken in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and by many overseas Hmong around the world, is one member of the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao group. A significant body of literature now exists in Hmong Njua in the RPA writing system used since the 1950's in Laos, Thailand and in western countries where overseas Hmong live. Speakers of the Hmong Njua lect, along with speakers of Hmong Daw, are probably the best-known members outside of China of this large over-arching ethnolinguistic group known as Miao or Hmong.\u201d"},

     'comment': u'retired in 2007 on request by Albert Bickford\n\nThere are clear distinctions in the sociolinguistic identies of the two linguistic communities which parallel the larger sociological and cultural distinctions between the Flanders (northern) and Walloon (sourthern) regions of Belgium. The actual linguistic differences are apparently less clear, yet the trend within the Deaf communities in these two regions is clearly toward establishing separate linguistic identities for the signed languages of the northern and southern parts of Belgium. For example:\n"In the past the term Belgian Sign Language was commonly used, because one believed there were more resemblances between the two sign languages used in Flanders and Wallonia than between those used in Flanders and the Netherlands. Also, the first sign language research in Belgium was carried out by Flemish and Walloon researchers together. In their publications they always mentioned Belgian Sign Language. Deaf people themselves spoke of signs or sign language without really specifying which one. A few years ago, the name changed. Because of the lack of sufficient linguistic evidence that would enable us to speak of two completely different sign languages, the compromise Flemish Belgian Sign Language was chosen to refer to the variant used in Flanders. However, because of the split of NAVEKADOS (the former Belgian Deaf Association) into a Flemish and a Walloon organization, reduced contact between the Flemish and Walloon Deaf and the different processes of standardization, Deaf people got more and more dissatisfied with the term Flemish Belgian and wanted to change it into Flemish. FEVLADO [the Flemish Deaf association, http://www.fevlado.be/] also advocated this change at an Annual General Meeting in October 2000. This is why from that moment on the term Flemish Sign Language is used in all publications concerning the Flemish Deaf community and their mother tongue." [http://gebaren.ugent.be/information.php].\n"In short, up until about fifteen years ago, people were usually signing, talking, and writing about Belgian Sign Language. Now, many Deaf people feel intuitively that the signed language used in Flanders is very different from the one used in the Netherlands (even though the two hearing communities speak the same language, Dutch) but that it is closer to the signed language used in Wallonia (although the Walloon hearing community speaks French). Right now, not enough linguistic evidence has been collected to know whether the differences between Flanders and Wallonia are big enough to allow talk about two different signed languages. Hence, as a good Belgian compromise, the term Flemish Belgian Sign Language was used in recent years for the signed language variants used in Flanders. However, because of the split of the national Deaf federation into two regional federations, the fewer and fewer contacts among both organizations and their members, and the separate standardization processes, most Deaf people in Flanders prefer to talk about Flemish Sign Language. This term is also the term that was adopted by Fevlado at its last annual general meeting (AGM) in October 2000. At that AGM, the participants were asked to vote for either the term Flemish Sign Language or the term Flemish Belgian Sign Language. The first option was nearly unanimously elected. Even though this choice is obviously more politically than linguistically motivated, I want to respect the opinion of the Flemish Deaf Association and its members and will talk about Flemish Sign Language from now on... [Mieke Van Herreweghe, 2002. "Turn-Taking Mechanisms and Active Participation in Meetings with Deaf and Hearing Participants in Flanders", in Turn-Taking, Fingerspelling, and Contact in Signed Languages, Ceil Lucas, ed., available online at http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/TTFCthree3.html]\nRegarding the situation in French-speaking Belgium (Wallonia and the major parts of Brussels), in the early 1980s, the term "Langue Franc\u0327aise Signe\u0301e" (Signed French Language) was used, then it changed into "Langue des Signes Belge" (Belgian Sign Language) or "Langue des Signes Franc\u0327aise de Belgique" (French Sign Language of Belgium). However, Deaf people have become quite unsatisfied with these terms and thus, another term was advocated. Since then, Langue des Signes Belge Francophone or Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone has been used during formal meetings although most deaf people still refer their language as "sign language". There was never a compromise on which term to use. Therefore, sign language researchers hired to write a report on the feasibility of an official recognition of the sign language used in French-speaking Belgium chose the term "Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone" and an abbreviation which reflected the close relationship between this sign language and French Sign Language : LSFB.\nAccording to Dr. Vermeerbergen, comprehension of LSFB by signers of VGT varies according to the person, the region from which the two signers are from, and the topic of conversation. For example, older Deaf from Flanders understand LSFB better than younger Deaf, who have had less contact with signers from Walloonia. This suggests that the comprehension is based on learned bidialectalism rather than inherent intelligibility. Those from central areas in Flanders understand LSBF better than those from peripheral areas, which is indication that the sign language situation in Belgium is in some respects a dialect chain which the Deaf communities in both regions have decided to break into two separate languages along political lines.\nThe Parliament of French-speaking Belgium recognised LSFB in a decree of October 2003, which acknowledges the existing internal variation and advocates allowing it to develop toward standardization along its own natural evolutionary path. The decree is available at http://www.fevlado.be/themas/gebarentaal/documenten/Decreet%20FBelg%20Gebarentaal.pdf.

Proof of their long presence in Myanmar is found in the ruins of many ancient mosques in Rakhine State, some over 500 years old. The Myanmar government, however, claims that the Rohingya are recent immigrants from Bangladesh, and has suppressed their language and attempted to drive the entire population to Bangladesh whose government has not accepted them. The language is Indo-Aryan, with an admixture of Persian, Arabic and some Burmese vocabulary. Tonal distinctions exist, a feature of Burmese but not usual in Indo-Aryan languages. Rohingya is closely related to but distinct from Chittagonian, which is reported to be understood by most men but not by most women."},

This proposal gives details regarding the proposed language "Lampung Api". "Api" is a modifier of "Lampung" and refers to this language\'s distinctive term for \'what?\' (as does "Nyo").\nWalker (1975) was a lexicostatistical comparison of various Lampungic lects. In the conclusion he delineated a number of dialects, including "Krui", "Pubian", "Southern Pesisir", "Ranau" (subsumed under Krui), and "Sungkai" (subsumed under Pubian). He nowhere stated that these were distinct languages. Hanawalt (forthcoming) and Anderbeck (forthcoming) validate the earlier lexicostatistic division of Lampungic and demonstrate how the various subgroups of Lampung Api (recognized by Walker 1975 as "Lampung Pesisir") cohere lexically, phonologically and in terms of intelligibility and should not be considered distinct languages.'},

Language surveys completed in 2006-2007 found comprehension between these Malay dialects, and a set of shared phonological innovations. The above "languages" should be listed as dialects of Musi.\nMUSI--language (internal structure) Musi group Palembang group\nMusi, Rawas, Pegagan Palembang, Lowland Malay\nIt was found that there was high reported comprehension between the speech varieties found along the coastal plain of South Sumatra and those centered around the city of Palembang, making a Palembang subgroup. The speech varieties of Downstream Lematang, Belide, and Penesak also had a high rate of reported comprehension, and form a Lowland Malay subgroup. The Palembang and the Lowland Malay subdialects together form the Palembang Malay subgroup of the Musi language. The other subgroup in the Musi language is the Musi subgroup, which is comprised of the Musi, Pegagan, and Rawas dialects. The Musi and Pegagan speech varieties share phonological innovations. Rawas has one of the phonological innovations, as well as some of its own. There is high reported comprehension between the Musi and Rawas and a high percentage of shared lexical items. The culture, phonological innovations, and reported comprehension in the Musi river basin dialect chain provide a reasonable basis for grouping these dialects of Malay (as ) as a distinct language. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic differences, distinct phonological innovations, along with lower reported comprehension between isolects of the Musi language and those of Central Malay (Pasemah, Semendo, Enim, etc.) argue against subsuming them all under "South Sumatran Malay".'},

The speech varieties listed as dialects of Northern Nambikuara [mbg] have been determined to be several separate but closely related languages / language dialect groups. Northern Nambikuara [mbg] should be changed from a language name to a part of the classification of the Nambiquaran languages.\nFor the classification of Nambiquaran languages, there should now be a distinction made between a Northern cluster and a Southern cluster. Currently there is only a distinction between two language groups Northern Nambikuara [mbg] and Southern Nambikaura [nab]. They are both listed in the Ethnologue as "Class: Nambiquaran". I am recommending that the Northern Nambikuara [mbg] language be split into potentially 6 separate languages / language dialect groups and that these 6 will receive new ISO language identity codes and should be classified as "Class: Nambiquaran, Northern". The Southern Nambikuara [nab] language should then be classified as "Class: Nambiquaran, Southern". The [nab] language has several dialects listed. These may be split into separate languages / language dialect groups at a later time. More research is needed before this can be done.\nIntelligibilty testing and interviews indicate that the dialects listed for this language, Northern Nambikuara [mbg], are actually separate languages / language dialect groups. These finding are also supported by ethnololinguistic identity as speakers of these separate languages do not view themselves as a single ethnic group, but rather as at least 8 separate ethnic groups with at least 6 separate languages being spoken by these 8 ethnic groups.'},

After clarifying those, however, there remains a need to specify Standard Malay (along with various local/vernacular Malay dialects and sociolects, e.g., Terengganu and Trade Malay)\nAji, or more properly, Haji, is proposed as a new language; see proposal for Haji (Aji) for more detail.\nPapuan Malay should be recognized as a separate language; see proposal for more detail\nThese steps will remove double listing of a speech variety as both a stand alone language in one listing, a dialect of a language in another listing, and a dialect of Malay in another listing, and also recognize the languages that warrant separate treatment. Goal-one listing for each speech variety.\nThe following elaborates on the clarifications regarding the Malaysian and Indonesian "Dialects" sections of the current Ethnologue entry for Malay [Malay]:\nFirst, there should be a listing of "Dialects" not only for Sumatra but also Kalimantan. Jakarta, another name for existing separate code element Betawi [bew] The following are currently listed under Sumatra for Malay [mly] but are actually spoken in Kalimantan and should be considered not a part of either Standard Malay or Local Malay: - Borneo (Sintang), and Kota-Waringin, both dialects of Malayic Dayak [xdy]\n- Labu (Lebu, Labu Basap), exists in the Ethnologue as Basap [bdb]\n- Balikpapan is represented in the Ethnologue as Banjar [bjn] - Bakumpai is a separate code element [bkr].\n(moving onto dialects outside Kalimantan):\n- Makassarese or Makasar Malay exists as a separate code element [mfp].\n- Manadonese (Menadonese) exists as a separate code element [xmm].\n- Mulak, another name for existing separate code element Kaur [vkk]\n- Bangka is the proposed expanded value for existing code element [mfb] (currently Lom) - Larantuka (Ende Malay) has been proposed as a separate code element. (cf. 2007-197) - Peranakan exists as a separate code element [pea]\n- Basa Kupang (Kupang) exists as a separate code element [mkn]\n- Belide, actually a dialect of Musi (cf 2007-182)\n- Daya, actually a dialect of Lampung Api (cf 2007-142); Lengkayap, another name for Daya\n- Aji is another name for Haji [hji] (proposed new code element)\n- Papuan Malay (Irianese) has been proposed to be a new code element [pmy].\nThere are also a few problems with the Malaysia "Dialects": Kedah, already an existing separate code element, Kedah Malay [meo]. Pasir Malay may refer to an area in East Kalimantan currently mapped as Banjar [bjn] rather than any dialect in Malaysia.\nThailand Malay probably refers to the separate code element Pattani Malay [mfa].\nWith this analysis, there remains a number of "local" or "vernacular" Malay language varieties that are not well differentiated from each other, as well as a number of language varieties for which further research is required to clarify their level of differentiation from more mainstream dialects. The following Sumatran dialects should be considered in this group: Tamiang, Deli, Riau mainland, Lubu, Akit, Sakai, Riau islands, coastal Jambi, and Belitung. Though not well defined, this should be considered a separate code element from Standard Malay.\n(Local) Malay currently listed under Sumatra but actually spoken in Kalimantan are: Sambas, Kota-Waringin, Sukadana, Ritok (Siantan, Pontianak), Sampit, West Borneo Coast Malay. This list of dialects would be better expressed as Sambas, Pontianak and Ketapang.\n(Local) Malay dialects in Peninsular Malaysia (mostly following Collins 1989) include but may not be limited to: coastal Terengganu, inland Terengganu, Kelantan (evidently mutually intelligible with Patani Malay), Pahang, Southeast Island, Orang Hulu, Orang Kuala, Jugra-Muar-Melaka-Johor. This list deliberately does not repeat the misleading dialect labels based on state boundaries. It also does not include the Malay varieties currently listed as separate Ethnologue entries, although some of these may be better understood also as Local Malay dialects: Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, Jakun, Orang Kanaq, Orang Seletar and Temuan.\n(Local) Malay dialects in Eastern Malaysia and Brunei include Sarawak, and one or more local Malay dialects are spoken in Brunei alongside the national Standard Malay variety.\nWhat remains is Standard Malay more narrowly specified (not including the above language varieties), also to be a new code element. Standard Malay (Bahasa Malaysia), the national language of Malaysia, differs substantially, particularly on the morphosyntactic level, from any described local Malay dialect.\n[RA comment: The clarification of "Malay (individual language)" must of necessity reference the Ethnologue entry for this language (Standard Malay). The current Ethnologue entry involves a large number of language varieties that already are or should be (on linguistic grounds) recognized as separate languages, along with numerous varieties that are more correctly recognized as being with the scope of other existing language code elements. Two new language code elements are being proposed as part of this refining of Standard Malay and separation of Local Malay from it. Because of this past confusion regarding what "Malay (Individual language)" should denote, and a clear narrowing of the desired denotation to be Standard Malay, the existing Malay [mly] code element must be retired.]'},

     'comment': u'request by Barb Waugh\n\nMonpa (or Moinba) is a cover term meaning "man of the lower country" and is used to refer to several ethnically related peoples which may not be related linguistically. Andvik states "The Monpa label is unfortunate, in that it separates languages which should be grouped together, while joining under a common name languages which should not be grouped together." Other publications (listed below) have indicated high variation in language among the Monpa groups we had previously listed under Moinba [mob].\nSurvey in 2005 has helped us sort out the various groups. The highest lexical similarity percentage among these 5 varieties are Chug with Lish - 62%. Informal comprehension testing indicated that Chug speakers had difficulty fully understanding a Lish story. The next highest similarity is Kalaktang with Tshangla_tsj - 62 \u2013 71%. Kalaktang speakers averaged 55% intelligibility of a Tshangla RTT with high standard deviation. Lish & Chug with Tawang and Kalaktang -15-21% LXS, Kalaktang with Tawang - 26-28% LXS. The closest language to Sartang is Sherdukpen with lexical similarity 49% to 60%. Sartang is less than 32% similar to the other 4 Monpa languages. Although I personally doubt the accuracy of the LXS numbers, they do indicate a great deal of variation which confirms similar statements by published sources.'},

     'comment': u'request by David Mead\n\nWhilst in the past two "Saluan" languages have been recognized, there have been at most only two reasons for doing so, and in neither case was the reason linguistic:\n(a) the Kahumamahon people in Simpang village were regarded by the Indonesian government as an exotic/isolated/primitive people (Indonesian: "suku terasing")\n(b) NTM mission was proceeding with a New Testament translation in Simpang village, while concurrently the Indonesian Bible Society was proceeding with a translation in Saluan as spoken in coastal areas.\nA linguistic basis for such a division, however, has never been made clear, and in fact no one has even known where to draw the border between these two supposed languages.\nIn 2001, I requested and obtained a 488-item word list of "Kahumamahon Saluan" from Robert Brown, then living in Simpang village and who knew the language well. A comparison of this word list with four other "Coastal Saluan" word lists which we had in hand suggested then that these were just one language. In 2006, an Indonesian colleague and I travelled the breadth of the Saluan area and collected seven additional word lists so that we could fully appraise the dialect situation. Whilst the isolect spoken in Simpang village is indeed divergent, all word lists scored above 80% in lexical similarity. Furthermore, "Kahomamahon" speakers themselves consider their language to be nothing other than a dialect of Saluan.\nWe are currently writng up the results of our research in a paper titled "An Initial Appreciation of the Dialect Situation in Saluan (Sulawesi, Indonesia)" (by David Mead and Edy Pasanda). Based on evidence from lexicostatistics, historical sound change and sociolinguistic interviews, we suggest that one Saluan language be recognized, which has three dialects:\nSaluan\n- Loinang dialect comprising three subdialects:\n= Lingketeng subdialect \n= Baloa\' subdialect \n= Kohumama\'on subdialect (<-- note corrected spelling)\n- Luwuk dialect \n- Kintom-Pagimana-Boalemo dialect\n\nTo this we can add:\n\nNo good cover term for the Kintom-Pagimana-Boalemo dialect emerged during the course of our visit, and perhaps each could also be considered its own subdialect.\nThe Loinang and Luwuk dialects are linked by the historical merger of word final *-n and *-l > *n, but the Luwuk and Kintom-Pagimana-Boalemo dialects are linked by higher lexical similarity.\nThe Luwuk dialect is spoken along the coast in the southeastern part of the Saluan language area, the Loinang dialect was formerly spoken in the interior, and the Kintom- Pagimana-Boalemo dialect elsewhere (on the coast). However, migrations of Saluan people from the interior to the coast over the past century has resulted in considerable dialect mixture in some coastal areas.'},

     'comment': u'request by Mark Woodward\n\nA sociolinguistic survey of the Suba peoples of Tarime District, Mara Region, Tanzania, was carried out by the SIL Tanzania Language Assessment Team in January and February 2006. This survey also included a short stay on Mfangano Island in Kenya, which is the heartland of the Kenyan Suba people and their language. During this time a 300-word wordlist was elicited in the Kenyan variety of Suba, and a 3-minute story was digitally recorded. The team then returned to Tanzania and spent 2 weeks researching the Tanzanian varieties spoken by the Suba and Simbiti peoples. In a total of 6 research locations wordlists were elicited and groups of people were invited to listen to the story elicited in Kenyan Suba. Almost without exception the Tanzanian Suba and Simbiti peoples had a great deal of difficulty understanding the Kenyan Suba, and all reported that it was more difficult to understand than the nearby Kuria and Zanaki languages. The comparison of wordlists similarly showed that the Kenyan Suba variety and the Tanzanian Suba and Simbiti varieties are distinct languages.\nTherefore the Language Assessment Team concluded that the Suba and Simbiti varieties hitherto considered to be part of the same language as that spoken by the Suba in Kenya, do in fact constitute a distinct language.'},

The term "Lampung" applies to the whole family (or the province); however the language family (formerly consisting of 9 Ethnologue entries) is best conceived as consisting of three closely-related languages: Lampung Api, Lampung Nyo and Komering (see Hanawalt et al. forthcoming for more details). This proposal gives details regarding the proposed language "Lampung Api". "Api" is a modifier of "Lampung" and refers to this language\'s distinctive term for \'what?\' (as does "Nyo").\nWalker (1975) was a lexicostatistical comparison of various Lampungic lects. In the conclusion he delineated a number of dialects, including "Krui", "Pubian", "Southern Pesisir", "Ranau" (subsumed under Krui), and "Sungkai" (subsumed under Pubian). He nowhere stated that these were distinct languages. Hanawalt (forthcoming) and Anderbeck (forthcoming) validate the earlier lexicostatistic division of Lampungic and demonstrate how the various subgroups of Lampung Api (recognized by Walker 1975 as "Lampung Pesisir") cohere lexically, phonologically and in terms of intelligibility and should not be considered distinct languages.'},

However, Upper Necaxa as spoken in Patla, Chicontla, San Pedro Tlalontongo, and Cacahuatla\u0301n is distinguished by (and recognized as a dialect in the region according to) a number of sound changes including the neutralization of a contrast between the voiceless lateral affricate and the voiceless lateral fricative.Tecpatla\u0301n Totonac has also undergone a shift of /w/ to /b/ (a sound not found at all in Upper Necaxa). There are a great many lexical distinctions that set Tecpatla\u0301n apart from the others.\nTecpatla\u0301n Totonac does, however, share one important sound change with the Upper Necaxa variety, the lenition of *q to a glottal stop and the concomittant collapse of historical fricative-q clusters to ejective fricatives. The shift is not quote complete in Tecpatla\u0301n, however, which retains /q/ in at least some lexical items. Tecpatla\u0301n and Upper Necaxa also share a shift in the grammatical paradigms so that many n-final verbs are treated as consonant-final stems for the purposes of perfective aspectual inflection (departing from the more common Totonacan pattern). These changes set Tecpatla\u0301n apart from Zihuateutla Totonac.'},

The differences between English and Yinglish are simply not comparable to the differences between German and Yiddish or Spanish and Ladino. In fact, Yinglish fits smoothly into the English dialect continuum. Yinglish is readily understood by speakers of plain English, provided the lexical items are explained, and even some of them have now entered the lexicon of colloquial American English, as your mavin Joshua Fishman notes. If there are enough unusual items, as in Yeshiva English, the speech may be unintelligible to the uninstructed listener, but no more so than the technical talk of pilots, doctors, or computer programmers. (Some borrowed words have un-English phonologies, but so do "Bach" and "oeuvre" as pronounced by many English speakers.) Furthermore, U.S. and U.K. Yinglish are about as different as U.S. and U.K. English, though segregating the first two into a separate language would lead us to expect that they would stand together as against non-Jewish dialects of English.  Orthographically (which is relevant to the sociolinguistics), Yinglish is invariably written in Latin script using mostly English conventions, quite unlike the various Jewish languages, which are mostly written in Hebrew script using their own conventions. Finally, the Ethnologue claim that Yinglish is "a second language only" is misleading. It is not a *second* language which some English-speakers also command; it is for the most part the particular way in which those English-speakers speak their first language, English (There are some Yinglish-speakers whose first Request for Change to ISO 639-3 Language Code, page 2\nlanguage is not English, of course.) Furthermore, the number and variety of Yinglish features in a particular speaker\'s speech (or writing) is under direct control: one can use more or fewer of them as appropriate. I\'ve used only one in this letter. (On a separate note, the term "Ameridish", listed in the Ethnologue as a synonym for Yinglish, wasn\'t originally meant to be: it was coined by Rosten to refer to Eastern Yiddish as spoken in the United States, with English lexical influences. He occasionally lost track of his own distinction, defining "opstairsiker/keh" as Yinglish and "donstairsiker/keh" as Ameridish for upstairs and downstairs neighbor respectively; both terms can be seen as either. But then again, Samuel Johnson defined "windward" and "leeward" the same way!)'},

Bradley has engaged in extensive research on Lipo dialects as part of his larger research focus on Central Ngwi varieties in general.

     'comment': u'request by Jamin R. Pelkey\n\nThis split is proposed based on findings from formal linguistic survey work on the Phula languages of Yunnan Province, China, carried out from 2005-2006. Eight of the 40 villages visited during this research period were closely affiliated ethnolinguistically with ISO code [ymj]. Research components explored lexicon, identity, contact and intelligibility, and the results point to five synchronically distinct languages originally subsumed under [ymj]. Communication and transportation have traditionally been limited between these varieties, though they are all closely related phylogenetically. The most vital and prototypical Muji variety, Southern Muji, also has the largest number of speakers. Rationale for identifying the other four languages as distinct from [ymj] is given below.\n[ymx] or Northern Muji speakers yeilded a mean score of .60 on a recorded text test from [ymc] with a high standard deviation of 24 suggesting that a mobile demographic has learned intelligibility with [ymj]. Anecdotal and perceptual information from [ymx] and [ymc] speakers alike confirms a distinction between the two, and speakers report significant learning time (longer than two months) being required in order to communicate in their respective Muji lects. A similar situation is reported between [ymx] and [ymz].\nThe smaller [ymi] and [ymq] (Moji and Qila Muji) varieties have apparently been separated from Muji proper for centuries and evidence numerous unique lexical and phonological characteristics as a result of independent change and language contact with other varieties. Lexical similarity in core vocabulary between these two and the other Muji varieties is lower than 60%--sufficiently low to posit the presence of mutually unintelligible synchronic languages without resorting to formal intelligibility testing. Although [ymq] shares a\nmarginal 60% core lexical similarity with [ymc], a [ymc] recorded text test played for [ymq] speakers yeilded a mean score of only .38 with a low standard deviation.\n[ymz] or Muzi speakers also scored low on the [ymc] recorded text test (.50) , and [ymx] speakers report that a bride who married out from their area to a [ymz] village required six months to one year before she was able to function in the [ymz] variety.'},

Speaker perceptions and recorded text test scores both point to low intelligibility between Phola [ypg] and Phala [ypa]*. Undirectional intelligibility from Phala to Phola is apparent in middle-aged to elderly speakers, but younger speakers who have had less contact are unable to converse in Phala or Phola and must resort to Chinese. Based on the views of in-group and out-group members alike, ethnic identity and material culture also confirm this distinction.\nThe proposed language [ypo], or Alo Phola, is reported by Phola speakers to be an unintelligible dialect of Phola spoken in a village in central Yuanjiang County. The village is surrounded by Dai villages, and Phola speakers say the language sounds like a mix of Phola, Chinese and Dai.

Pelkey\n\nWumeng and Wusa have long been recognized as distinct varieties of Nasu, but Wumeng is spoken primarily in Guizhou Province with some speakers also living in Yunnan Province (thus matching the [ywu] profile), and Wusa is spoken only in Guizhou Province (thus matching the [yig] profile). The Ethnologue profile associated with [ywm], however, claims that the language is spoken only in Yunnan. The confusion, then, can likely be traced back to a lack of understanding regarding a single variety spoken on both sides of a provincial line. Thus, [ywm] should be merged into [ywu], the [ywu] reference name should be changed to reflect the Wumeng distinction, and the [yig] reference name should be changed to reflect the Wusa distinction (cf. the related [ywu] and [yig] reference name change applications).'},

     'comment': u'request by Cathryn Yang\n\nSouthern and Southwestern Nisu were originally grouped together and referred to as Yuanjiang-Mojiang Nisu. However, the lack of mutual intelligibility between these two varieties suggests instead that they should be split into two distinct languages. During 2006, Ken Chan (also with EAG) and Cathryn Yang carried out a dialect survey of Nisu, in which they tested Northern and Southern Nisu speakers if they could understand a Southwestern Nisu RTT. Only one Northern Nisu data point could adequately comprehend (RTT score avg. 80%); all the other N and S Nisu points failed to adequately comprehend SW Nisu (scores below 80%, often 50 or 60%). Also, they tested SW Nisu speakers on how well\nthey could understand N and S Nisu varieties. The SW Nisu speakers were unable to adequately comprehend any of the other Nisu varieties. SW Nisu is linguistically very closely related to both N and S Nisu, but the speakers moved away from the Northern Nisu area several generations ago to the southwest. Because of the lack of mutual intelligibility with other Nisu languages, Chan and Yang concluded that SW Nisu was a related but divergent Nisu language.Northern Nisu refers to [yiv], currently named Eshan-Xinping Yi (name change requested).'},
