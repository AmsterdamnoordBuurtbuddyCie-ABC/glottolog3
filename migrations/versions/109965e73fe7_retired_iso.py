     'comment': u'retired in 2008 on request by Ian Tupper\n\n\u201cAn SIL-PNG survey (Kassell, MacKenzie and Potter 2005) found the three proposed languages were distinct from each other, using both lexicostatistical and intelligibility testing. Average lexical similarity of the three speech varieties is between 39% and 58%, as measured with a 170-item standard word list. The accepted threshold for regarding speech varieties as dialects of a single language is 70% lexical similarity (SIL 1991); these scores are well below that threshold. Testing of intelligibility found that speakers of each variety had 13 - 56% comprehension of recorded texts in the other varieties. SIL guidelines give a recorded text test score of 75% as the lowest acceptable indicator of comprehension; again these scores are well below that threshold. The survey team concluded that Andai, Nanubae and Tapei should be considered three distinct languages.\u201d'},

However, even though they are closer geographically to Adzera villages, historically and linguistically they are more closely related to the Mari and Wampur languages, and are thus in a different subfamily of the Upper Markham language family to Adzera. Susanne Holzknecht has documented the linguistic differences in: Holzknecht, Susanne. 1989. The Markham Languages of Papua New Guinea. Pacific Linguistics C-115. Canberra: Australian National University. Her work provides sufficient proof that these speech varieties are indeed separate languages that belong in the Mountain subgroup of Upper Markham languages, rather than being included as dialects of Adzera. Malcolm Ross also treats these three languages as distinct languages of the Upper Markham subfamily in his 1986 Ph.D. dissertation, later published as: Ross, Malcolm D. 1988.

     'comment': u'retired in 2008 on request by David Mead \n\n\u201cIn 1908, the Dutch administrator O. E. Goedhart visited Batui. In a somewhat odd-seeming practice today, he named the people\u2019s speech the \u2018Baha language\u2019 after their negative term. In this he was partly in error, because the word for \u2018no\u2019 in Batui is actually mbaha\u2019. In 1914, the Dutch linguist N. Adriani further compounded the error by surmising that Baha must be a dialect of the nearby Pamona language. Adriani\'s basis was (a) geographical proximity, and (b) that the negative term "baha" superficially resembled "bare\'e" of the Pamona language.\nSadly, no one bothered to check things out further. Instead, as the years passed, the claim was repeated on language atlases and other writings about Sulawesi languages. People forgot about the shaky foundation upon which it had been built, and thus error had become "linguistic fact".\nIn 2006 we collected (in fact, became the first to collect) first-hand information on the Batui language, and discovered that Batui is not even closely related to Pamona at all, but shares its greatest affinities with the Saluan-Banggai languages to the east. Including Batui (or Baha) as a dialect of Pamona was nothing other than an egregious error.\u201d'},

     'comment': u"retired in 2008 on request by Conrad Hurd\n\nHmong Njua [blu] should be retired, split into Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao, Small Flowery Miao, Horned Miao and Hmong Njua. Until now Hmong Njua [blu] as described in the Ethnologue 15th ed. was awkwardly forced to encompass a large number of Chuanqiandian Miao lects. The specific variety Hmong Njua (or Hmongb Nzhuab), appearing under country headings for Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar and also spoken by many overseas Hmong around the world, is one member of the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao group. Thus Hmong Njua has been used in two senses until now, denoting a broad category of several dozen Chuanqiandian lects, and in a much narrower sense, denoting one specific variety within that broad category. Because from now on it would be unclear in any given use of the identifier as to whether [blu] meant the old, overly broad Hmong Njua, or the new, more proper Hmong Njua, the identifier [blu] must be retired from use. The specific variety Hmong Njua should be given a new identifier to remove that ambiguity, and the broad category of Chuanqiandian lects should be split into four new entries.\nChinese linguists normally organize the broad category of Chuanqiandian lects, formerly represented in the Ethnologue by the lect best known overseas, Hmong Njua, into three or\nfour clusters of closely related lects. They call these three clusters \u5ddd\u9ed4\u6ec7\u65b9\u8a00\u5ddd\u9ed4\u6ec7\u6b21\u65b9 \u8a00\u7b2c\u4e00\u3001\u7b2c\u4e8c\u3001\u7b2c\u4e09\u3001\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u571f\u8bed. In English these could be translated as the first, second,\nthird and fourth local dialects of the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect of the Chuanqiandian dialect of the Miao language.\nChinese linguists have arranged these multiple varieties in three or four groups based on closeness of genetic relationship, determined through analysis of extensive word lists, and on estimates of inherent intelligibility, gained through observations of ability to communicate across lects in the mother tongue.\nWhile the many lects within the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao group (corresponding to the first local dialect described by Chinese linguists) do differ somewhat in phonology and lexicon, and their speakers have autonyms, clothing and customs distinct from other subgroups within the cluster, and while marriage tends to be within the same subgroup, there is fairly good inherent intelligibility at a functional level across lects within the cluster.\nSmall Flowery Miao or Gha-Mu, corresponding to the second local dialect described by Chinese linguists, is a distinct ethnolinguistic subgroup with its own clear identity. Through historical reconstruction Chinese linguists have determined that the Small Flowery Miao lect is closely related to other lects within the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect, and they state that there is partial intelligibility between this lect and Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao (the first local dialect).\nSinicized Miao or Hmong Sa, posited by at least one Chinese linguist (Li Yunbing) as a fourth local dialect of the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect, is also a distinct ethnolinguistic sub- group, and is phonologically more divergent from the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao lects (the first local dialect) than Small Flowery Miao is from the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao lects. There is marginal intelligibility between Sinicized Miao and either Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao lects or Small Flowery Miao. It is believed, however, that this is the same language that is already represented by the code [hmz] Hmong Shua, previously identified as only being used in Vietnam. Thus, this proposal recommends an expansion of the denotation of [hmz] Hmong Shua to incorporate this lect as spoken in China (cf change request 2007-132)\nHorned Miao, although it has been classified in several different ways by Chinese linguists, is also a distinct ethnolinguistic sub-group speaking a variety of Miao that is phonologically divergent from other lects in the Chuanqiandian sub-dialect and only partially intelligible with them.\nThe specific variety Hmong Njua (or Hmongb Nzhuab), spoken in China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and by many overseas Hmong around the world, is one member of the Chuanqiandian Cluster Miao group. A significant body of literature now exists in Hmong Njua in the RPA writing system used since the 1950's in Laos, Thailand and in western countries where overseas Hmong live. Speakers of the Hmong Njua lect, along with speakers of Hmong Daw, are probably the best-known members outside of China of this large over-arching ethnolinguistic group known as Miao or Hmong.\u201d"},

     'remedy': 'Split into Langue des signes de Belgique Francophone [sfb], and Vlaamse Gebarentaal [vgt]',
     'comment': u'retired in 2007 on request by Albert Bickford\n\nThere are clear distinctions in the sociolinguistic identies of the two linguistic communities which parallel the larger sociological and cultural distinctions between the Flanders (northern) and Walloon (sourthern) regions of Belgium. The actual linguistic differences are apparently less clear, yet the trend within the Deaf communities in these two regions is clearly toward establishing separate linguistic identities for the signed languages of the northern and southern parts of Belgium. For example:\n"In the past the term Belgian Sign Language was commonly used, because one believed there were more resemblances between the two sign languages used in Flanders and Wallonia than between those used in Flanders and the Netherlands. Also, the first sign language research in Belgium was carried out by Flemish and Walloon researchers together. In their publications they always mentioned Belgian Sign Language. Deaf people themselves spoke of signs or sign language without really specifying which one. A few years ago, the name changed. Because of the lack of sufficient linguistic evidence that would enable us to speak of two completely different sign languages, the compromise Flemish Belgian Sign Language was chosen to refer to the variant used in Flanders. However, because of the split of NAVEKADOS (the former Belgian Deaf Association) into a Flemish and a Walloon organization, reduced contact between the Flemish and Walloon Deaf and the different processes of standardization, Deaf people got more and more dissatisfied with the term Flemish Belgian and wanted to change it into Flemish. FEVLADO [the Flemish Deaf association, http://www.fevlado.be/] also advocated this change at an Annual General Meeting in October 2000. This is why from that moment on the term Flemish Sign Language is used in all publications concerning the Flemish Deaf community and their mother tongue." [http://gebaren.ugent.be/information.php].\n"In short, up until about fifteen years ago, people were usually signing, talking, and writing about Belgian Sign Language. Now, many Deaf people feel intuitively that the signed language used in Flanders is very different from the one used in the Netherlands (even though the two hearing communities speak the same language, Dutch) but that it is closer to the signed language used in Wallonia (although the Walloon hearing community speaks French). Right now, not enough linguistic evidence has been collected to know whether the differences between Flanders and Wallonia are big enough to allow talk about two different signed languages. Hence, as a good Belgian compromise, the term Flemish Belgian Sign Language was used in recent years for the signed language variants used in Flanders. However, because of the split of the national Deaf federation into two regional federations, the fewer and fewer contacts among both organizations and their members, and the separate standardization processes, most Deaf people in Flanders prefer to talk about Flemish Sign Language. This term is also the term that was adopted by Fevlado at its last annual general meeting (AGM) in October 2000. At that AGM, the participants were asked to vote for either the term Flemish Sign Language or the term Flemish Belgian Sign Language. The first option was nearly unanimously elected. Even though this choice is obviously more politically than linguistically motivated, I want to respect the opinion of the Flemish Deaf Association and its members and will talk about Flemish Sign Language from now on... [Mieke Van Herreweghe, 2002. "Turn-Taking Mechanisms and Active Participation in Meetings with Deaf and Hearing Participants in Flanders", in Turn-Taking, Fingerspelling, and Contact in Signed Languages, Ceil Lucas, ed., available online at http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/TTFCthree3.html]\nRegarding the situation in French-speaking Belgium (Wallonia and the major parts of Brussels), in the early 1980s, the term "Langue Franc\u0327aise Signe\u0301e" (Signed French Language) was used, then it changed into "Langue des Signes Belge" (Belgian Sign Language) or "Langue des Signes Franc\u0327aise de Belgique" (French Sign Language of Belgium). However, Deaf people have become quite unsatisfied with these terms and thus, another term was advocated. Since then, Langue des Signes Belge Francophone or Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone has been used during formal meetings although most deaf people still refer their language as "sign language". There was never a compromise on which term to use. Therefore, sign language researchers hired to write a report on the feasibility of an official recognition of the sign language used in French-speaking Belgium chose the term "Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone" and an abbreviation which reflected the close relationship between this sign language and French Sign Language : LSFB.\nAccording to Dr. Vermeerbergen, comprehension of LSFB by signers of VGT varies according to the person, the region from which the two signers are from, and the topic of conversation. For example, older Deaf from Flanders understand LSFB better than younger Deaf, who have had less contact with signers from Walloonia. This suggests that the comprehension is based on learned bidialectalism rather than inherent intelligibility. Those from central areas in Flanders understand LSBF better than those from peripheral areas, which is indication that the sign language situation in Belgium is in some respects a dialect chain which the Deaf communities in both regions have decided to break into two separate languages along political lines.\nThe Parliament of French-speaking Belgium recognised LSFB in a decree of October 2003, which acknowledges the existing internal variation and advocates allowing it to develop toward standardization along its own natural evolutionary path. The decree is available at http://www.fevlado.be/themas/gebarentaal/documenten/Decreet%20FBelg%20Gebarentaal.pdf. Official recognition of VGT by the government in Flanders was granted in April 2006 (http://www.fevlado.be/nieuws/nieuwsDetail.aspx?item=150). The proposed text of the decree is available at http://jsp.vlaamsparlement.be/docs/stukken/2005-2006/g729-2.pdf.'},

Proof of their long presence in Myanmar is found in the ruins of many ancient mosques in Rakhine State, some over 500 years old. The Myanmar government, however, claims that the Rohingya are recent immigrants from Bangladesh, and has suppressed their language and attempted to drive the entire population to Bangladesh whose government has not accepted them. The language is Indo-Aryan, with an admixture of Persian, Arabic and some Burmese vocabulary. Tonal distinctions exist, a feature of Burmese but not usual in Indo-Aryan languages.

This proposal gives details regarding the proposed language "Lampung Api". "Api" is a modifier of "Lampung" and refers to this language\'s distinctive term for \'what?\' (as does "Nyo").\nWalker (1975) was a lexicostatistical comparison of various Lampungic lects. In the conclusion he delineated a number of dialects, including "Krui", "Pubian", "Southern Pesisir", "Ranau" (subsumed under Krui), and "Sungkai" (subsumed under Pubian). He nowhere stated that these were distinct languages. Hanawalt (forthcoming) and Anderbeck (forthcoming) validate the earlier lexicostatistic division of Lampungic and demonstrate how the various subgroups of Lampung Api (recognized by Walker 1975 as "Lampung Pesisir") cohere lexically, phonologically and in terms of intelligibility and should not be considered distinct languages.'},

The above "languages" should be listed as dialects of Musi.\nMUSI--language (internal structure) Musi group Palembang group\nMusi, Rawas, Pegagan Palembang, Lowland Malay\nIt was found that there was high reported comprehension between the speech varieties found along the coastal plain of South Sumatra and those centered around the city of Palembang, making a Palembang subgroup. The speech varieties of Downstream Lematang, Belide, and Penesak also had a high rate of reported comprehension, and form a Lowland Malay subgroup. The Palembang and the Lowland Malay subdialects together form the Palembang Malay subgroup of the Musi language. The other subgroup in the Musi language is the Musi subgroup, which is comprised of the Musi, Pegagan, and Rawas dialects. The Musi and Pegagan speech varieties share phonological innovations. Rawas has one of the phonological innovations, as well as some of its own. There is high reported comprehension between the Musi and Rawas and a high percentage of shared lexical items. The culture, phonological innovations, and reported comprehension in the Musi river basin dialect chain provide a reasonable basis for grouping these dialects of Malay (as ) as a distinct language. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic differences, distinct phonological innovations, along with lower reported comprehension between isolects of the Musi language and those of Central Malay (Pasemah, Semendo, Enim, etc.) argue against subsuming them all under "South Sumatran Malay".'},

The speech varieties listed as dialects of Northern Nambikuara [mbg] have been determined to be several separate but closely related languages / language dialect groups. Northern Nambikuara [mbg] should be changed from a language name to a part of the classification of the Nambiquaran languages.\nFor the classification of Nambiquaran languages, there should now be a distinction made between a Northern cluster and a Southern cluster. Currently there is only a distinction between two language groups Northern Nambikuara [mbg] and Southern Nambikaura [nab]. They are both listed in the Ethnologue as "Class: Nambiquaran". I am recommending that the Northern Nambikuara [mbg] language be split into potentially 6 separate languages / language dialect groups and that these 6 will receive new ISO language identity codes and should be classified as "Class: Nambiquaran, Northern". The Southern Nambikuara [nab] language should then be classified as "Class: Nambiquaran, Southern". The [nab] language has several dialects listed. These may be split into separate languages / language dialect groups at a later time. More research is needed before this can be done.\nIntelligibilty testing and interviews indicate that the dialects listed for this language, Northern Nambikuara [mbg], are actually separate languages / language dialect groups. These finding are also supported by ethnololinguistic identity as speakers of these separate languages do not view themselves as a single ethnic group, but rather as at least 8 separate ethnic groups with at least 6 separate languages being spoken by these 8 ethnic groups.'},

     'comment': u'request by Katharina Wolf\n\nDuring a sociolinguistic survey in November 2004 we visited the people group known in Chad as Mimi. They call themselves Amdang and their language Amdangti. There was no evidence of other Mimi populations and other Mimi dialects. The population figure of both Mimi and Amdang as recorded in the Ethnologue 15th ed. is roughly 40,000, but these appear to be the same 40,000. I suggest collapsing the entries for amj and miv into amj, thus calling the Mimi language of Chad "Amdang".'},

     'remedy': 'Split into four languages: Standard Malay [zsm], Haji [hji], Papuan Malay [pmy] and Malay (individual language) [zlm]',
     'comment': u'request by Karl Anderbeck\n\nMalay as described in the Ethnologue 15th ed. currently has several dialects listed under Sumatra, many of which are in other areas of Indonesia besides Sumatra, and of which eighteen are already listed as separate languages or dialects of other separate languages, or should be listed on their own as separate languages. Other country listings for Malay have similar issues. After clarifying those, however, there remains a need to specify Standard Malay (along with various local/vernacular Malay dialects and sociolects, e.g., Terengganu and Trade Malay)\nAji, or more properly, Haji, is proposed as a new language; see proposal for Haji (Aji) for more detail.\nPapuan Malay should be recognized as a separate language; see proposal for more detail\nThese steps will remove double listing of a speech variety as both a stand alone language in one listing, a dialect of a language in another listing, and a dialect of Malay in another listing, and also recognize the languages that warrant separate treatment. Goal-one listing for each speech variety.\nThe following elaborates on the clarifications regarding the Malaysian and Indonesian "Dialects" sections of the current Ethnologue entry for Malay [Malay]:\nFirst, there should be a listing of "Dialects" not only for Sumatra but also Kalimantan. Jakarta, another name for existing separate code element Betawi [bew] The following are currently listed under Sumatra for Malay [mly] but are actually spoken in Kalimantan and should be considered not a part of either Standard Malay or Local Malay: - Borneo (Sintang), and Kota-Waringin, both dialects of Malayic Dayak [xdy]\n- Labu (Lebu, Labu Basap), exists in the Ethnologue as Basap [bdb]\n- Balikpapan is represented in the Ethnologue as Banjar [bjn] - Bakumpai is a separate code element [bkr].\n(moving onto dialects outside Kalimantan):\n- Makassarese or Makasar Malay exists as a separate code element [mfp].\n- Manadonese (Menadonese) exists as a separate code element [xmm].\n- Mulak, another name for existing separate code element Kaur [vkk]\n- Bangka is the proposed expanded value for existing code element [mfb] (currently Lom) - Larantuka (Ende Malay) has been proposed as a separate code element. (cf. 2007-197) - Peranakan exists as a separate code element [pea]\n- Basa Kupang (Kupang) exists as a separate code element [mkn]\n- Belide, actually a dialect of Musi (cf 2007-182)\n- Daya, actually a dialect of Lampung Api (cf 2007-142); Lengkayap, another name for Daya\n- Aji is another name for Haji [hji] (proposed new code element)\n- Papuan Malay (Irianese) has been proposed to be a new code element [pmy].\nThere are also a few problems with the Malaysia "Dialects": Kedah, already an existing separate code element, Kedah Malay [meo]. Pasir Malay may refer to an area in East Kalimantan currently mapped as Banjar [bjn] rather than any dialect in Malaysia.\nThailand Malay probably refers to the separate code element Pattani Malay [mfa].\nWith this analysis, there remains a number of "local" or "vernacular" Malay language varieties that are not well differentiated from each other, as well as a number of language varieties for which further research is required to clarify their level of differentiation from more mainstream dialects. The following Sumatran dialects should be considered in this group: Tamiang, Deli, Riau mainland, Lubu, Akit, Sakai, Riau islands, coastal Jambi, and Belitung. Though not well defined, this should be considered a separate code element from Standard Malay.\n(Local) Malay currently listed under Sumatra but actually spoken in Kalimantan are: Sambas, Kota-Waringin, Sukadana, Ritok (Siantan, Pontianak), Sampit, West Borneo Coast Malay. This list of dialects would be better expressed as Sambas, Pontianak and Ketapang.\n(Local) Malay dialects in Peninsular Malaysia (mostly following Collins 1989) include but may not be limited to: coastal Terengganu, inland Terengganu, Kelantan (evidently mutually intelligible with Patani Malay), Pahang, Southeast Island, Orang Hulu, Orang Kuala, Jugra-Muar-Melaka-Johor. This list deliberately does not repeat the misleading dialect labels based on state boundaries. It also does not include the Malay varieties currently listed as separate Ethnologue entries, although some of these may be better understood also as Local Malay dialects: Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, Jakun, Orang Kanaq, Orang Seletar and Temuan.\n(Local) Malay dialects in Eastern Malaysia and Brunei include Sarawak, and one or more local Malay dialects are spoken in Brunei alongside the national Standard Malay variety.\nWhat remains is Standard Malay more narrowly specified (not including the above language varieties), also to be a new code element. Standard Malay (Bahasa Malaysia), the national language of Malaysia, differs substantially, particularly on the morphosyntactic level, from any described local Malay dialect.\n[RA comment: The clarification of "Malay (individual language)" must of necessity reference the Ethnologue entry for this language (Standard Malay). The current Ethnologue entry involves a large number of language varieties that already are or should be (on linguistic grounds) recognized as separate languages, along with numerous varieties that are more correctly recognized as being with the scope of other existing language code elements. Two new language code elements are being proposed as part of this refining of Standard Malay and separation of Local Malay from it. Because of this past confusion regarding what "Malay (Individual language)" should denote, and a clear narrowing of the desired denotation to be Standard Malay, the existing Malay [mly] code element must be retired.]'},

     'comment': u'request by Barb Waugh\n\nMonpa (or Moinba) is a cover term meaning "man of the lower country" and is used to refer to several ethnically related peoples which may not be related linguistically. Andvik states "The Monpa label is unfortunate, in that it separates languages which should be grouped together, while joining under a common name languages which should not be grouped together." Other publications (listed below) have indicated high variation in language among the Monpa groups we had previously listed under Moinba [mob].\nSurvey in 2005 has helped us sort out the various groups. The highest lexical similarity percentage among these 5 varieties are Chug with Lish - 62%. Informal comprehension testing indicated that Chug speakers had difficulty fully understanding a Lish story. The next highest similarity is Kalaktang with Tshangla_tsj - 62 \u2013 71%. Kalaktang speakers averaged 55% intelligibility of a Tshangla RTT with high standard deviation. Lish & Chug with Tawang and Kalaktang -15-21% LXS, Kalaktang with Tawang - 26-28% LXS. The closest language to Sartang is Sherdukpen with lexical similarity 49% to 60%. Sartang is less than 32% similar to the other 4 Monpa languages. Although I personally doubt the accuracy of the LXS numbers, they do indicate a great deal of variation which confirms similar statements by published sources.'},

     'comment': u'request by David Mead\n\nWhilst in the past two "Saluan" languages have been recognized, there have been at most only two reasons for doing so, and in neither case was the reason linguistic:\n(a) the Kahumamahon people in Simpang village were regarded by the Indonesian government as an exotic/isolated/primitive people (Indonesian: "suku terasing")\n(b) NTM mission was proceeding with a New Testament translation in Simpang village, while concurrently the Indonesian Bible Society was proceeding with a translation in Saluan as spoken in coastal areas.\nA linguistic basis for such a division, however, has never been made clear, and in fact no one has even known where to draw the border between these two supposed languages.\nIn 2001, I requested and obtained a 488-item word list of "Kahumamahon Saluan" from Robert Brown, then living in Simpang village and who knew the language well. A comparison of this word list with four other "Coastal Saluan" word lists which we had in hand suggested then that these were just one language. In 2006, an Indonesian colleague and I travelled the breadth of the Saluan area and collected seven additional word lists so that we could fully appraise the dialect situation. Whilst the isolect spoken in Simpang village is indeed divergent, all word lists scored above 80% in lexical similarity. Furthermore, "Kahomamahon" speakers themselves consider their language to be nothing other than a dialect of Saluan.\nWe are currently writng up the results of our research in a paper titled "An Initial Appreciation of the Dialect Situation in Saluan (Sulawesi, Indonesia)" (by David Mead and Edy Pasanda). Based on evidence from lexicostatistics, historical sound change and sociolinguistic interviews, we suggest that one Saluan language be recognized, which has three dialects:\nSaluan\n- Loinang dialect comprising three subdialects:\n= Lingketeng subdialect \n= Baloa\' subdialect \n= Kohumama\'on subdialect (<-- note corrected spelling)\n- Luwuk dialect \n- Kintom-Pagimana-Boalemo dialect\n\nTo this we can add:\n\nNo good cover term for the Kintom-Pagimana-Boalemo dialect emerged during the course of our visit, and perhaps each could also be considered its own subdialect.\nThe Loinang and Luwuk dialects are linked by the historical merger of word final *-n and *-l > *n, but the Luwuk and Kintom-Pagimana-Boalemo dialects are linked by higher lexical similarity.\nThe Luwuk dialect is spoken along the coast in the southeastern part of the Saluan language area, the Loinang dialect was formerly spoken in the interior, and the Kintom- Pagimana-Boalemo dialect elsewhere (on the coast). However, migrations of Saluan people from the interior to the coast over the past century has resulted in considerable dialect mixture in some coastal areas.'},

     'comment': u'request by Mark Woodward\n\nA sociolinguistic survey of the Suba peoples of Tarime District, Mara Region, Tanzania, was carried out by the SIL Tanzania Language Assessment Team in January and February 2006. This survey also included a short stay on Mfangano Island in Kenya, which is the heartland of the Kenyan Suba people and their language. During this time a 300-word wordlist was elicited in the Kenyan variety of Suba, and a 3-minute story was digitally recorded. The team then returned to Tanzania and spent 2 weeks researching the Tanzanian varieties spoken by the Suba and Simbiti peoples. In a total of 6 research locations wordlists were elicited and groups of people were invited to listen to the story elicited in Kenyan Suba. Almost without exception the Tanzanian Suba and Simbiti peoples had a great deal of difficulty understanding the Kenyan Suba, and all reported that it was more difficult to understand than the nearby Kuria and Zanaki languages. The comparison of wordlists similarly showed that the Kenyan Suba variety and the Tanzanian Suba and Simbiti varieties are distinct languages.\nTherefore the Language Assessment Team concluded that the Suba and Simbiti varieties hitherto considered to be part of the same language as that spoken by the Suba in Kenya, do in fact constitute a distinct language.'},

In the conclusion he delineated a number of dialects, including "Krui", "Pubian", "Southern Pesisir", "Ranau" (subsumed under Krui), and "Sungkai" (subsumed under Pubian). He nowhere stated that these were distinct languages. Hanawalt (forthcoming) and Anderbeck (forthcoming) validate the earlier lexicostatistic division of Lampungic and demonstrate how the various subgroups of Lampung Api (recognized by Walker 1975 as "Lampung Pesisir") cohere lexically, phonologically and in terms of intelligibility and should not be considered distinct languages.'},

However, Upper Necaxa as spoken in Patla, Chicontla, San Pedro Tlalontongo, and Cacahuatla\u0301n is distinguished by (and recognized as a dialect in the region according to) a number of sound changes including the neutralization of a contrast between the voiceless lateral affricate and the voiceless lateral fricative.Tecpatla\u0301n Totonac has also undergone a shift of /w/ to /b/ (a sound not found at all in Upper Necaxa). There are a great many lexical distinctions that set Tecpatla\u0301n apart from the others.\nTecpatla\u0301n Totonac does, however, share one important sound change with the Upper Necaxa variety, the lenition of *q to a glottal stop and the concomittant collapse of historical fricative-q clusters to ejective fricatives. The shift is not quote complete in Tecpatla\u0301n, however, which retains /q/ in at least some lexical items. Tecpatla\u0301n and Upper Necaxa also share a shift in the grammatical paradigms so that many n-final verbs are treated as consonant-final stems for the purposes of perfective aspectual inflection (departing from the more common Totonacan pattern).

The differences between English and Yinglish are simply not comparable to the differences between German and Yiddish or Spanish and Ladino. In fact, Yinglish fits smoothly into the English dialect continuum. Yinglish is readily understood by speakers of plain English, provided the lexical items are explained, and even some of them have now entered the lexicon of colloquial American English, as your mavin Joshua Fishman notes. If there are enough unusual items, as in Yeshiva English, the speech may be unintelligible to the uninstructed listener, but no more so than the technical talk of pilots, doctors, or computer programmers. (Some borrowed words have un-English phonologies, but so do "Bach" and "oeuvre" as pronounced by many English speakers.) Furthermore, U.S. and U.K. Yinglish are about as different as U.S. and U.K. English, though segregating the first two into a separate language would lead us to expect that they would stand together as against non-Jewish dialects of English.  Orthographically (which is relevant to the sociolinguistics), Yinglish is invariably written in Latin script using mostly English conventions, quite unlike the various Jewish languages, which are mostly written in Hebrew script using their own conventions. Finally, the Ethnologue claim that Yinglish is "a second language only" is misleading. It is not a *second* language which some English-speakers also command; it is for the most part the particular way in which those English-speakers speak their first language, English (There are some Yinglish-speakers whose first Request for Change to ISO 639-3 Language Code, page 2\nlanguage is not English, of course.) Furthermore, the number and variety of Yinglish features in a particular speaker\'s speech (or writing) is under direct control: one can use more or fewer of them as appropriate. I\'ve used only one in this letter. (On a separate note, the term "Ameridish", listed in the Ethnologue as a synonym for Yinglish, wasn\'t originally meant to be: it was coined by Rosten to refer to Eastern Yiddish as spoken in the United States, with English lexical influences. He occasionally lost track of his own distinction, defining "opstairsiker/keh" as Yinglish and "donstairsiker/keh" as Ameridish for upstairs and downstairs neighbor respectively; both terms can be seen as either. But then again, Samuel Johnson defined "windward" and "leeward" the same way!)'},

     'comment': u'request by Jamin R.

Eight of the 40 villages visited during this research period were closely affiliated ethnolinguistically with ISO code [ymj]. Research components explored lexicon, identity, contact and intelligibility, and the results point to five synchronically distinct languages originally subsumed under [ymj]. Communication and transportation have traditionally been limited between these varieties, though they are all closely related phylogenetically. The most vital and prototypical Muji variety, Southern Muji, also has the largest number of speakers. Rationale for identifying the other four languages as distinct from [ymj] is given below.\n[ymx] or Northern Muji speakers yeilded a mean score of .60 on a recorded text test from [ymc] with a high standard deviation of 24 suggesting that a mobile demographic has learned intelligibility with [ymj]. Anecdotal and perceptual information from [ymx] and [ymc] speakers alike confirms a distinction between the two, and speakers report significant learning time (longer than two months) being required in order to communicate in their respective Muji lects. A similar situation is reported between [ymx] and [ymz].\nThe smaller [ymi] and [ymq] (Moji and Qila Muji) varieties have apparently been separated from Muji proper for centuries and evidence numerous unique lexical and phonological characteristics as a result of independent change and language contact with other varieties. Lexical similarity in core vocabulary between these two and the other Muji varieties is lower than 60%--sufficiently low to posit the presence of mutually unintelligible synchronic languages without resorting to formal intelligibility testing. Although [ymq] shares a\nmarginal 60% core lexical similarity with [ymc], a [ymc] recorded text test played for [ymq] speakers yeilded a mean score of only .38 with a low standard deviation.\n[ymz] or Muzi speakers also scored low on the [ymc] recorded text test (.50) , and [ymx] speakers report that a bride who married out from their area to a [ymz] village required six months to one year before she was able to function in the [ymz] variety.'},

Speaker perceptions and recorded text test scores both point to low intelligibility between Phola [ypg] and Phala [ypa]*. Undirectional intelligibility from Phala to Phola is apparent in middle-aged to elderly speakers, but younger speakers who have had less contact are unable to converse in Phala or Phola and must resort to Chinese. Based on the views of in-group and out-group members alike, ethnic identity and material culture also confirm this distinction.\nThe proposed language [ypo], or Alo Phola, is reported by Phola speakers to be an unintelligible dialect of Phola spoken in a village in central Yuanjiang County. The village is surrounded by Dai villages, and Phola speakers say the language sounds like a mix of Phola, Chinese and Dai.

These three distinct identities are recognized by ingroup and outgroup Phowa speakers alike and find expression not only in autonyms but also in material culture as is sometimes reported in Chinese sources such as KYSZ (1996).'},

     'comment': u'request by Jamin R. Pelkey\n\nWumeng and Wusa have long been recognized as distinct varieties of Nasu, but Wumeng is spoken primarily in Guizhou Province with some speakers also living in Yunnan Province (thus matching the [ywu] profile), and Wusa is spoken only in Guizhou Province (thus matching the [yig] profile). The Ethnologue profile associated with [ywm], however, claims that the language is spoken only in Yunnan. The confusion, then, can likely be traced back to a lack of understanding regarding a single variety spoken on both sides of a provincial line. Thus, [ywm] should be merged into [ywu], the [ywu] reference name should be changed to reflect the Wumeng distinction, and the [yig] reference name should be changed to reflect the Wusa distinction (cf. the related [ywu] and [yig] reference name change applications).'},

     'comment': u'request by Cathryn Yang\n\nSouthern and Southwestern Nisu were originally grouped together and referred to as Yuanjiang-Mojiang Nisu. However, the lack of mutual intelligibility between these two varieties suggests instead that they should be split into two distinct languages. During 2006, Ken Chan (also with EAG) and Cathryn Yang carried out a dialect survey of Nisu, in which they tested Northern and Southern Nisu speakers if they could understand a Southwestern Nisu RTT. Only one Northern Nisu data point could adequately comprehend (RTT score avg. 80%); all the other N and S Nisu points failed to adequately comprehend SW Nisu (scores below 80%, often 50 or 60%). Also, they tested SW Nisu speakers on how well\nthey could understand N and S Nisu varieties. The SW Nisu speakers were unable to adequately comprehend any of the other Nisu varieties. SW Nisu is linguistically very closely related to both N and S Nisu, but the speakers moved away from the Northern Nisu area several generations ago to the southwest. Because of the lack of mutual intelligibility with other Nisu languages, Chan and Yang concluded that SW Nisu was a related but divergent Nisu language.Northern Nisu refers to [yiv], currently named Eshan-Xinping Yi (name change requested).'},

Nu nationality intellectuals have confirmed that there are four languages spoken by members of this nationality group: Drung (which will probably need to be split into Drung and Anung/Along), Nusu, Rourou and Anong. There is no record of any language named "Ayi" spoken by members of the Nu nationality in Chinese literature or in the knowledge of local Nu intellectuals and therefore we conclude this is an\nerror due to the similar appearance of the characters \u4fac (nong) and \u4f9d (yi).'},

     'comment': u"retired in 2012 on request by Joseph Lovestrand\n\n\u201cEarly linguistic survey of the area highlighted many distinguishing features of the Nyokon language (Richardson 1957:28-31). Lexicostatistical studies have shown that the linguistic similarity between the two speech varieties (Tunen and Nyokon) is so low that there is no possibility of inherent understanding. Mous and Breedveld show that the percentage of similar lexical items between the two languages is as low as 36% (1986:184). A previous study by Schadeberg and Voorhoeve gave a figure of approximately 50% (1977:24). Both studies show that Tunen is more closely related to Nomaande (Mandi) ([lem]) than to Nyokon. Field notes from D. Barreteau reveal that the class system of Nyokon does not align with Tunen, each containing classes and gender pairs that do not occur in the other. This data confirms the early (and still accepted) classification of Nyokon as a separate\nlanguage labeled A.45 in Guthrie's system (1971, Maho 2003:641). Nyokon (niny\u01e4'\u01e4) has also been given the language number code 514 in the Administrative Atlas of the National Languages of Cameroon (Breton and Fohtung 1991: 39). Mous, in his studies of Tunen, specifically presents Nyokon as a related language and not a dialect (2003:283).

     'comment': u'retired in 2010 on request by Lawrence A. Reid\n\n\u201cThe present reference name used with [bkb], Finallig, is erroneous; that name should be used to refer only to the dialect spoken in the community of Barlig, Mountain Province, the Philippines, and cannot appropriately be used to refer to the language of other closely related dialects of Eastern Bontok that are spoken in the Barlig municipality, such as Kenachakran (spoken in Kadaklan), or Linias (spoken in Lias), who would never label their language variety as Finallig (see Fukuda 1997:11, 1980), or to the distinctively different Southern Bontok varieties.\nCurrently this code element (as described in the Ethnologue) has three "alternate names": Eastern Bontoc, Kadaklan-Barlig Bontoc, and Southern Bontoc. The term "Kadaklan- Barlig" appears nowhere in the literature, although Kadaklan and Barlig do so separately (see Fukuda 1997:11, 1980, etc.). The term Southern Bontoc was proposed by Busenitz (1973) in an unpublished SIL survey.\nAlthough Eastern Bontok is closely related to Southern Bontok (that is the dialects spoken in the communities of Can-eo, Talubin and Bayyo) , each has a markedly different phonology from the others., e.g., the pre-vocalic variants of /b/ and /d/, which are voiceless (and fricativized) in Central and Eastern languages are voiced in Southwestern Bontok, and the aspirated voiceless variant of /g/ found in Central and Eastern languages is lost, i.e., /g/ has no prevocalic variant at all. Eastern Bontok dialects of both Barlig and Kadaklan have a unique palatalized, voiceless, fricativized variant of /b/ and /d/ before /a/, written _fia_ (hence _Fiallig_, the local pronunciation of Barlig) and _cha_, respectively, which is not found in the Southern dialects. The reflex of *schwa in Southern Bontok is schwa, as in the Central Bontok dialects, whereas in the Eastern dialects it has fallen together with a back vowel /u/ (sometimes also represented as o). Southern dialects also have developed an /o/ vowel, but from a completely different source than the Eastern dialects (see Kikusawa and Reid 2003 for the developments in the Talubin dialect that is known as Tinoveng).\n\nThere are a wide range of both morphological and syntactic features that distinguish Eastern and Southern dialects, discussed in Kikusawa and Reid (2003). The Southern dialects of Talubin and Bayyo are strongly influenced also from their proximity to the neighboring languages to the south, the various dialects of Ifugao. These communities are located on the main road between Bontoc town and the Ifugao municipality of Banaue.\nAlthough Talubin and Bayyo are listed as dialects of Eastern Bontok based on an unpublished SIL survey by Busenitz in 1973 (cited by Fukuda 1997:11, Busenitz called all Eastern dialects Southern), my own research shows that the varieties are distinct enough in phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon to be considered separate languages.\nApart from the linguistic differences between the two groups of dialects, speakers of the Eastern Bontok varieties have rejected the label Southern Bontok, since historically they have been enemies (especially of the Can-eo people), and even today have vivid memories of headhunting exploits of one group against the other.\nThe reference name "Bontok, Eastern" matches the proposed macrolanguage name "Bontok", and correctly positions them geographically in the Eastern area of Mountain Province. The communalects of Kadaklan and Barlig are referred to as Eastern Bontoc in several publications (Fukuda 1980, 1981, 1992,1997, and Pang 1998.)\u201d'},

At any rate, the distinctions they make need to be made at the level of dialect designations or codes, not language codes.

Clan lists as well as some vocabulary items are included and make it easier to identify which groups were being referred to.\nThe Awa Khami and Ahraing Khami vocabulary items from the 1931 Census are very similar to each other and match with wordlists collected from the group today known as Mro-Khimi.\nThe Mro-Khimi today recognize two broad sub-groupings, Wakung (\u201cdownstream\u201d) and Areung (\u201cupstream\u201d). The speech variety spoken by the vast majority of people is known as Wakung. \u2018Wa\u2019 is a Rakhine/Burmese word meaning \u201cmouth of a stream\u201d. \u2018Kung\u2019 is a Mro-Khimi word also meaning \u201cmouth of a stream\u2019. This \u201cAwa Khami\u201d clan lists from the 1931 Census match with the current Wakung clans, making identification clear.\nThe Areung sub-group includes multiple speech varieties, including Hrengna and Xata. This sub- group matches with the Ahraing Khami in the 1931 Census.\nThe Wakung and Areung groups consider themselves to belong to one common overall group, Mro- Khimi, and speak similar speech varieties. Thus, they are grouped together here under one ISO entry.\nRegarding the name for the group, there is currently some disagreement. While most of the group uses the name Mro-Khimi, those living in Buthidaung Township use the name Khimi. The majority group has chosen to include Mro in their name to distinguish themselves from the Khumi, who live in Paletwa Township, Chin State. However, the group living in Buthidaung Township does not have contact with the Khumi. Instead, they distinguish themselves from the Mru who live nearby by not including \u201cMro\u201d in their name. Both groups agree, however, that they do not want to be called \u201cChin\u201d.\nFor the ISO entry, we have chosen to use the name chosen by the majority with a note about the situation in Buthidaung Township.\nIn the 1931 Census, the vocabulary lists of "Mro" match with wordlists from the group today known as Mru (mro), not Mro-Khimi. This group lives in Bangladesh and Myanmar and speaks a very divergent speech variety from the Mro-Khimi. They are known by a variety of other names including Mrung, Mrusa, Dak, Launghu, and Taung \u201cmountain\u201d Mru.\nMru (mro) is already represented by a distinct ISO entry, and the current Mro (cmr) entry has up until now been used to refer to the Mro-Khimi. Thus, for clarity, it would be better to merge the Chin, Khumi Awa (cka) and Chin, Mro (cmr) entries and change the name to Mro-Khimi.'},

     'comment': u'request by Valentin Vydrin\n\nKla-Dan is different enough from the Dan to make mutual intelligibility marginal; the percentage of cognates in Swadesh\'s 100-wordlist between Kla-Dan and different Dan dialects varies between 88 and 90%. Kla-Dan and Dan have no common literature; Kla- Dan speakers have an ethnolinguistic identity of their own, separate from the rest of Dan.\nDan and Kla-Dan can still be regarded as closely related languages, their speakers are aware of their common origin. Kla-Dan speakers do not accept their common identity with "Yakuba", the term commonly used in Co\u0302te d\'Ivoire for the other Dan speakers, but they agree that they belong to the Dan community.\nFurther explanation from email:\nAbout Dan and Kla-Dan: well... I see the point. For me, 90% of Swadesh\'s 100-word list is about the limit of inellegibility. In the Mande families, there are lots of varieties which are considered as separate languages although they have 95 to 98% of cognates in the 100- wordlist with other ones! If we take the 80% range as the limit, I\'m afraid, many European languages will loose their status of languages...\nIt is true that when a 100-wordlis is collected badly, or based on unreliable and incomplete data, or do not take account of established regular correspondences, the rate is normally lower than in the contrary case. For example, in Ronald Long\'s dissertation (1971) "A comparative study of the Northern Mande languages" (which is still regarded by many as the main reference in the field), the rates are systematically lower than in my analysis (2009). Here are some examples:\nLong 1971 Susu-Maninka 27-36%\nMandinka-Maninka 79-83%\nMau-Maninka 74-93%\nVai-Maninka 53-62%\netc. - this tendency is valid for every pair of languages without exception! Therefore, if I want to justify the necessity to split one language into two, I can simply take Long\'s data (instead of mine), and the critics will be convinced. Isn\'t it absurd?'},

Neither of the surveys report any language by the name of Elpaputih. There are two languages on the Elpaputih Bay which may have been included in the Elpaputih language amq (Amahai), plh (Paulohi).

     'comment': u'request by Ivan Miani\n\nThe name Emilia-Romagna can be very confusing. I would like to explain why I think the term Emilia-Romagna is misleading when referring to regional culture which includes aspects such as language, customs, and cuisine, and should only be referred to for geopolitical reasons.\nTwo ISO 639 codes, one for Emilia and one for Romagna would be much clearer when referring to the cultural aspects of both regions.\nThe sole reason why this code exists is because in 1948 with the inception of the Italian Constitution, the Region of Emilia-Romagna was created. This name never previously existed in Italian history. Emilia and Romagna had been two different regions of Italy in the past.\nFrom 1815 to 1866 two historical regions of Italy, Lombardia and Veneto, were merged to create the Lombardian-Venetian Kingdom. Nevertheless, nobody referred to Milan nor Venice as Lombardian-Venetian cities, Milan still remained a Lombardian city , and Venice remained a Venetian city. The same holds true for Emilia-Romagna. Bologna is an Emilian city while Ravenna is a Romagnol city. The term \u201cEmiliano-Romagnolo\u201d makes sense only if looking at the political region of Italy called \u201cEmilia-Romagna\u201d.\nMoreover, there is Emilian cuisine and Romagnol cuisine. There isn\u2019t an Emilia-Romagnian cuisine in Italy. The \u201cRomagnol Riviera\u201d, and not the \u201cEmilia-Romagna Riviera\u201d, is the famous tourist area along the Northern Adriatic Sea.\nThere is an Emilian dialect and a Romagnol dialect. There isn\u2019t such a thing as an Emilian- Romagnolo dialect. A counter-factual example: if in 1948 two regions had been created, Emilia and Romagna, no one could have ever imagined the existence of an Emilia- Romagnol language!\nNowadays, Italy is seeing a revival of dialects, after a period over the last 40 years when regional dialects couldn\'t be spoken on national TV or radio. Many cultural institutes were established to keep dialects alive in both Emilia and Romagna. For example, in Romagna the Istituto F. Schurr was founded in 1996 and it\'s still involved with the conservation of Romagna\'s dialect as an important part of the region\u2019s heritage.\nHere is a brief history of the \u201cEmilia\u201d and \u201cRomagna\u201d names. Before 1948 there weren\'t geopolitical regions in Italy. There were about 90 provinces, and Emilia and Romagna were two clearly distinctive regions. Before the unification of Italy in 1861, one could find on a map only the name Romagna, or \u201cRomagne\u201d, the Italian plural of Romagna. The name Emilia, instead, did not appear. Instead of Emilia one could find the \u201cdukedom of Ferrara\u201d, the \u201cdukedom of Modena and Reggio\u201d, and other dukedoms. Historically and culturally, Emilia and Romagna were formed many centuries before the creation of this geopolitical region. People from these regions have the feeling of being "Romagnol" or "Emilian". It is very evident to anyone who is from either of these two regions. I know, for example, that I\'m Romagnol, an inhabitant of Romagna, as well as any Bolognese citizen knows she/he\'s Emilian.\nAllow me to present some points of consideration:\n1) Let\'s pretend that Emilians are 90% of population of Emilia-Romagna and Romagnols are only the 10%. So one could think that Romagnols could be considered just an appendix of the Region.\nReply: There are 1 million Romagnols in a region of 4 million people.\nPrinciple Romagnol towns include Ravenna, with a population of 150,000 people, Rimini, with 135,000, Forli\u0300, with 115,000, and Cesena with 95,000.\n2) Some may consider definitive evidence of the existence of Emilian-Romagnol language as having an Italo-Emilian-Romagnol dictionary.\nReply: There has never been such a dictionary. We have dictionaries of Romagnolo- Italiano and Bolognese-Italiano, or Modenese-Italiano (Modenese is the dialect of Modena, the second biggest town of Emilia).\n3) Could the definitive evidence of the existence of Emilian-Romagnol language be the mutual intelligibility?\nNo, because there is not mutual intelligibility. There are certain features in the Romagnol dialect which differ greatly from the Emilian dialect; for they can be classified as two distinct dialects. These dialectical differences are very evident to a linguist.\nAn example: atonic vocalism.\nSome words that in Latin were trisyllabic or quadrisyllabic (where the \'u\' final is atonic) are reduced in Romagnol to monosyllable. The atonic syllable is cut off.\nLatin GENUCULU becomes in Romagnol ZNO\u0300C Latin TEPIDU becomes in Romagnol TEVVD Latin OCULU becomes in Romagnol O\u0300C\nLatin FRIGIDU becomes in Romagnol FRE\u0301DD\n(Italian: ginocchio (Italian: tiepido) (Italian: occhio) (Italian: freddo)\nThis didn\'t happen in Emilia: that\'s why an Emilian speaker is not used to hearing words with atonic vowels removed. Emilians don\'t understand Romagnol. On the contrary, every Romagnol \u201cfeels\u201d Emilian dialects as very similar to Italian (because Italian is full of vowels).\n4) Emilian and Romagnol do not share a common literature. Romagnol literature begins in the late XVI century with Pvlon matt. There is critical edition of the poem in English, translated by British linguist Douglas Bartlett Gregor. This is the card of the book:\nMad Nap ("Pvlon Matt"): An anonymous Romagnol poem of the sixteenth century translated into English verse and Italian prose, and annotated / D. B. Gregor. - Cambridge : The Oleander Press, c1976. - 237 p.\nPvlon Matt was reviewed also by Friedrich Schu\u0308rr (1888-1980), an eminent linguist who first acknowledged Romagnol as a romance language.'},

The first generation was bilingual, but the Toba language later became established as the \'language of men\'" (Susnik 1989: 144), and supposedly went on to form "a \'Maskoyized\' proletariat in the tannin factories" of Puerto Casado (ibid.). Our research leaves no doubt that the indigenous population of the tannin ports on the River Paraguay is of purely Enlhet-Enenlhet descendency. In spite of the existence of communities such as Cerrito and El Padernal where people of Enlhet- Enenlhet and Qom descendency live together, bilingualism across the two language groups has not developed, and Guarani is the main language of intercommunication. That is, an Emok language (classified as extinct) in fact never existed. Emmo\'ok is not the name of a language; it means simply \'our neighbour\' in the languages of the Enlhet-Enenlhet family.

Gabutamon people reported understanding speakers from all Domung villages well, and speakers from all but two Domung villages reported understanding people from Gabutamon well. The two Domung villages that reported to not understand Gabutamon speakers well are from the opposite end of the Domung dialect chain. People from Gabutamon and other Domung villages are working together successfully on a Scripture translation project.\nReported data suggests that there is a dialect chain in the Domung area with Gabutamon at one end and Sibgou, Kian, Dirit and Maramung at the other. Each village had a different way of breaking the chain into dialects. Putting the different reported dialects together suggests the chain is as follows, starting from the Gabutamon end: Gabutamon; Maum and Kosit; Wakopop and Bobongat; Aunon; Ayengket; Sibgou, Kian, Dirit, Swantan and Maramung. This is shown in the attached map.\nLexical similarity percentages support the fact that Gabutamon village is part of the Domung dialect chain. The map shows that Gabutamon is as closely related to Domung villages as the other Domung villages are to each other. For example, Gabutamon and Kian, villages on the opposite ends of the Domung dialect chain, both share 70% or more lexical similarity with two central Domung villages (Bobongat and Ayengket).\nThe criteria used by the survey team (based on 1991 ILAC recommendations) to determine language boundaries is listed below.\n-At least 70% lexical similarity with a linguistically determined central dialect;\n-Either high reported comprehension of a central dialect or intelligibility of at least 75% of a central dialect\n-Shared ethnolinguistic identity with the central dialect\nVillages at both ends of the Domung dialect chain (Gabutamon and Kian) meet these criteria and should be included as part of the Domung language.\nSee map sketch on final page (http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2009-044.pdf).'},

     'comment': u'request by Anthony Aristar, head of the MultiTree Team\n\nThe languages were probably misanalyzed as dialects of a single language because, as Breen admits "Garrwa and Wanyi are superficially very similar" (2003: 426). He concludes an extensive comparison of the two languages by saying "The many correspondences in grammar, especially the pronoun inventories, confirm the conclusion that these languages are closely related, but at the same time the substantial differences in grammar suggest that they must be mutually unintelligible -- closely related languages rather than dialects of a language" (2003: 454).\nGarrwa and Wanyi have about 50% shared lexicon, either identical words or confirmed cognates. Nominal morphology is more or less similar but by far the most significant difference is the verbal system. Wanyi has no evidence of the clitic system that Garrwa uses to express TAM, and prefers a richer verb conjugation to express these instead. Belfrage (2003) corroborates these conclusions of Breen, and while he revises the verb analysis so that the two languages resemble each other even further, he maintains the assertion that the languages are distinct.\nPerhaps contributing to the confusion is the asymmetrical distribution of the two: they both occupy areas about the same size, but per Walsh (1981) Garrwa had "300+" speakers while Wanyi had a questionable "10?". Moreover, Walsh recognizes the dichotomy and goes so far as to list Garrwa and Wanyi as distinct subgroups within a larger family. As Breen (2003) explains, the situation is more complex than it seems on the surface. Garrwa in fact has two or three true dialects--Western Garrwa and Eastern Garrwa, the latter of which may or may not be distinguishable from another variety called Kunindirri (2003: 426).\nIn terms of higher-level organization, Austin mentions that "The two closely-related languages Garawa and Wanyi are spoken in an area immediately north of Wagay. In vocabulary and morphology they are very different from all the languages discussed above, and are classified as members of a distinct language family by O\'Grady et al" (1981: 327). Breen calls this family "Yanyi," explaining "I have used the name Yanyi (the word for \'language\' in these languages) for the group for a number of years... and propose this as a name for the group that makes no implications regarding its status and does not imply primacy for either language" (2003: 426).'},

Since the only reference for Horuru is Voegelin 1965 which is somewhat of a survey of several languages and the only note about Horuru is that it may be an alternate for another languoage or extinct, the original inclusion of Horuru seems to be a little weak. Yalahatan, which is spoken in only two villages (Yalahatan and Haruru), matches well with the classification of Horuru, both being in the Three Rivers linguistic grouping. The geographic location of Horuru is simply Central Maluku, Seram which is home to several languages, one of which isYalahatan. Since there's no language polygon, the location could be anywhere on the island of Seram, but nowhere else in Seram is there a village by the name Horuru or a tribe that goes by that name (based on the government statistic data from 2000). The closest to the name Horuru is the village Haruru which speaks a dialect of the Yalahatan language (Sakiyama 1999 and Beckley personal communication)."},

     'comment': u'request by Nicholas Rolle\n\nThe change I am proposing is that Ibilo [ibi] be changed from being a language within [Edo- Esan-Ora, North Central, Edoid, Benue-Congo, Volta-Congo, Atlantic-Congo, Niger-Congo], and be moved to being a dialect of Okpamheri [opa], located within the Northwestern Edoid branch.\nI have found no publication which places Ibilo within this subclassification. Nor have I found any dialect called "Ibilo" in these languages. In talking to Prof. Ron Schaefer (Southern Illinois University Edwardsville), who has extensive first hand experience with Emai and other Edoid languages, he knows of no languages or dialects called Ibilo in North Central. He also says that Ibillo is the principal village in the Okpamheri cluster, which include about 20 or so villages.\nFurther, Ben Elugbe (University of Ibadan) has written extensively on comparitive Edoid.\nElugbe (1989a: 24) cites that he used the Ibilo dialect of Okpamheri in his comparative work, and Elugbe (1989b: 296) notes that the Ibilo dialect is spoken in Ibilo town, and is a dialect of Okpamheri. He further provides in (1989b: 296) the consonant inventory of Ibilo, showing it has breathy voiced consonants, and a lenis/nonlenis distinction. These are features of the Northwest branch. The Edo-Esan-Ora language group of North Central, within which Ibilo is classified by Ethnologue, do not contain these phonological features.\nAlso, your map 6 of Nigeria (found at http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=NG&seq=80) shows that the code for Ibilo on the map is 305. This places it in the Northwest area of Edoid languages, not the North Central.\nFinally, in a non-linguistics article, Oseni (1991: 224) notes Okpamheri people from a town "Ibillo".\nThese facts, I feel, warrant that its status as an independent language, with its own language code, be removed, unless there is some distinct evidence to classify it as a separate language from Okpamheri [opa].\nThere is the possiblity that evidence and documentation exists that Ibilo is its own language within the North Central branch, or that perhaps it is some dialect of a North Central branch language, which happens to be homophonous with a dialect of Okpamheri in the Northwest branch. If this is the case, I would be very interested to see which sources this information comes from.'},

     'comment': u'request by Charles E. Grimes\n\nFor East Timor, we noted previously that the Galolen Language Council told me they have a dialect spoken on the island of Wetar in SW Maluku in then village of Iliwaki. I have now compared my Galolen [gal] data with the Talur wordlist in Hinton (2000: Pacific Linguistics 503:105-129), which was taken in the village of Iliwaki, and his data are 95% lexically similar with my Galolen data. The forms that are the same are actually identical. The forms that are different (e.g. names for bamboo) could easily refer to different species. THEY ARE THE SAME LANGUAGE. Note that SIL member Bryan Hinton shows the Talur data quite divergent from the other Wetar lgs (he excludes it from the "Wetar cluster" (p.110-111). He lists "Galoleng" as an alternate name for Talur (p.113). He continues (p.113), "While in the Talur language area, I was told that the language was the same as the language spoken in East Timor in the region around Manututo. This roughly corresponds to the Galoli language area shown in the Wurm and Hattori (1981) map of Timor. Salzner (1960) even includes Galoli as a dialect of Wetar located in East Timor. Capell (1944) notes, \'.the language of Wetar is almost identical with that of the Galoli country in Timor.\' .. This Timor connection for the Talur language could explain why it is divergent from the language groups of the Wetar cluster. So basically, all sources are in convergence. Talur should be listed as a dialect of Galolen [gal], with the hub in East Timor.'},

     'comment': u'request by Ethnologue Editor\n\nThe entry for Karen, Paku contained Mobwa as a dialect in the past. However, speakers of Mobwa report low inherent intelligibility with Paku. Based on low reported comprehension and separate identities, it seems that Mobwa should be considered a separate language from Paku. In addition, Mobwa is treated as a distinct variety from Paku in the linguistic literature.\nRegarding Mobwa being different from Paku and from Sgaw, there is an article by Shintani (2001) in which he did lexicostatistical analysis of various Karen varieties, including Sgaw, Paku, and Mobwa. He found 79% similarity between Mobwa and Paku and put them in separate groupings. He found 74% similarity between Mobwa and Sgaw and put them in separate groupings.\nThe Mobwa live among the Bwe, but have to switch to Sgaw or Burmese to communicate with them. They do not have much contact with Paku people, have low understanding of Paku, and have a distinct identity from the Paku.'},

     'comment': u"request by Hannes Kalisch\n\nThe Enxet were first contacted in 1989 by Anglican missionaries from Concepcio\u0301n; the Enlhet in 1927 by Mennonite immigrants from Puerto Casado (today Puerto La Victoria). Both of these groups, of European origin, referred to the indigenous of the interior of the Chaco as 'Lengua', even before having met them. This coincidence of names has led to the two ethnic groups being considered as a single one. In view of the linguistic differences between them, it has been proposed that two dialects, Lengua Sur [Southern Lengua] and Lengua Norte [Northern Lengua] should be distinguished. This proposal, which is not based on linguistic criteria, has been put forward even in the most recent attempts at classification (Campbell & Grondona), without comparative research being carried out in the field (see the extensive bibliography in Fabre (2005/2012)). However, on the basis of their linguistic research into the six languages of the Enlhet-Enenlhet family, Unruh & Kalisch (2003) have proposed that they should be seen as two different languages, since the Enlhet and Enxet languages are not mutually intelligible, and clearly distinct ethnolinguistic identities exist. An indicator of this is the fact that there is a considerable number of people who are bilingual Enlhet-Enxet.\nAt the same time, it is not possible to understand one of the languages as a dialect of the other; that is, the existing code does not represent a 'major language'. From the perspective of the whole family, the Enlhet and Enxet languages are of equal standing in relation to each other and to the other languages of the family."},

New Caledonian official statistics also gives a single number of speakers for both dialects as one.\nWhile the cover page of the Acade\u0301mie des langues Kanak site http://www.alk.gouv.nc/portal/page/portal/alk/langues lists Ti\u0302ri\u0302 and Me\u0301a separately when listing the various languages and main dialects spoken in different custom areas, this because its aim is to celebrate local linguistic diversity.

Different ethnic groups of the Enlhet-Enenlhet (or Maskoy) family certainly have lived together in the Puerto La Victoria area (just as in several other regions of the Chaco), but, as we observe in these contexts today (and as witnesses indicate regarding the Puerto La Victoria region in the past), no type of pidgin has developed. Either a dominant language has been used by all, or members of each group have used their own language and the others have developed the ability to understand it (a passive bi- or multilingualism). In addition, in areas of contact between Enlhet-Enenlhet languages, the ethnic groups of this family have quickly begun to speak Guarani with each other. In any case, today no Enlhet-Enenlhet language is spoken in the Puerto La Victoria region; ethnic groups belonging to the Enlhet-Enenlhet speak an adapted version of Paraguayan Guarani.'},

This work is apparently merely repeating a ethnonym cited by a non-linguist foreigner in 1949. The original work does not claim this to be a unique language.

     'comment': u'request by Anthony Aristar, head of the MultiTree Team\n\nIt is our proposal that the entry currently listed as "Maykulan" (mnt) in Ethnologue 16 has a series of "alternate names" which actually represent a collection of languages under a Mayi group (currently Mayabic). These languages--Mayi-Kulan, Mayi-Thakurti, Mayi-Yapi, and Wunumara--will join the level of the existing Mayaguduna (xmy) and Ngawun (nxn).\nThere are multiple publications discussing the above-mentioned varieties as languages.\nPollock (2011) and Hinton & Hale (2004) clearly denote the Mayi-Yapi people as a separate people from their neighbors. Hinton & Hale illustrate this with a map of the region, a dotted line labeled "ethnographic boundary" dividing the Mayi-Yapi from the Mayi-Kutuna (2004: 21). Pollock lists various river catchments and local peoples, for example the Flinders River Catchment has listed under Indigenous peoples groups: Mayi-Yapi, Mayi- Kulan, Mayi-Thakurti, while other catchments have not all of these listed.\nBlair (2001) cites several examples from the languages, for example "jerry-jerry, the annual herb Ammannia multiflora of Queensland, is from Mayi-Yapi and Mayi-Kulan, spoken around the Cloncurry Riverand the Norman River, north Queensland" (141-2).\nAlpher (1991) in section 8.2 "Languages cited for etymological information" uses Mayi- Kulan and Mayi-Yapi languages as references.\nATSIDA has a database of language groups and peoples, listing the Mayi-Kulan, Mayi- Thakurti, Mayi-Yapi, and Wunumara peoples as separate entries. AusAnthrop also has separate entires for the peoples, under the names Maijabi, Mayi-Kulan, Mayi-Thakurti Wanamara.\nI cannot neglect to mention perhaps the best publication concerning these languages, Breen\'s "The Mayi Languages of the Queensland Gulf Country" which provides, among other evidence, a 656 "concept list" with translations in all the Mayi languages illustrating the similarities and differences (e.g. 5). The book also provides an overview of cultural differences between the different peoples and notes several phonological differences between the languages (e.g. 29).'},

The ISO codes taken from Ethnologue represent some of the dialects of different Mayan languages, but are not even a complete or accurate listing of dialects. At any rate, the distinctions they make need to be made at the level of dialect designations or codes, not language codes. If for some reason it is decided to maintain dialect distinctions in the codes for Mayan languages instead of merging the separate codes, then each language needs a separate general code to designate the language as a whole rather than one of its dialects. The languages about which there is still some discussion are: Achi (most linguists agree that it is a dialect (group) of K\u2019ichee\u2019, but speakers have chosen overwhelmingly to identify it as a separate language), Cholti\u2019 (separate extinct language or ancestral language?), Motozintlec and Tuzantec (dialects of Mocho\u2019 or separate languages?).

     'comment': u'request by Margarita Castro, PhD\n\nBased on phonological, grammatical, and lexical differences (see attached documentation), there are two linguistic variants in this language which make it difficult to convert materials in one variant directly to the other. When speakers of the two variants try to communicate in their language, they have so much trouble understanding each other that they usually use Spanish instead. Furthermore, there are several words that appear to be the same in the two variants that show significant semantic shift. There is approximately 85% comprehension between the two variants, which makes the speakers think they should be able to communicate in their language, but in fact they usually find it impossible. This has been confirmed by linguistic and sociolinguistic studies (see bibliography).\nIn the cultural realm, the Eastern variant has conserved more of their traditional beliefs than has the Western variant, where only some very elderly speakers still know them. Another factor has been the invasion of the Eastern variant by migrating speakers of Southeastern Tepehuan (stp), causing cultural and linguistic changes. In the Western variant, there are fewer such influences, especially in the communities in Durango State (San Agustin de Buenaventura, Curachitos de Buenavista, San Diego, Tepetates II (Berenjenas), Alacranes and Tepalcates). Except for Tepalcates, all these communities still use the language in all aspects of daily life, probably because there are few other linguistic influences in their isolated area. They even use Nahuatl when they talk on their "walkie talkies." Thus this area can be considered the heart of the ethnic group, because there the language and culture are preserved.\nThere are, however, some trends toward moderization that threated their cultural identity.\nIn Nayarit State, the same Western variant is spoken in four places (Santa Cruz, La Laguna, Mesa de las Arpas, and El Duraznito). The language is more threatened there, since these four communities have fewer speakers and are surrounded by large communities of Cora and Huichol speakers. This has caused the loss of the language in some parts to the extent that symptoms of language death are evident. In the schools of these four communities, Nayarit State has created a program to promote the use of the language, including training teachers in the language and in positive attitudes toward it, but in the homes it is often not spoken by the children, although they still understand it. The older traditional authorities also favor the creation of materials to promote the use of the language.'},

     'comment': u'request by John William Eppele\n\nIn short, the rationale for this proposed change is that no proper evidence has ever been presented for Pongyong\'s [pgy] existence as a unique language. As far as Nepali linguists can tell, this is a "ghost entry" in the ISO 639-3. \u201cPongyong\u201d is a Rai clan name (Van Driem 2001:623). It is unlikely to be a separate language from Saam [raq]. The existence of Pongyong as a unique language was originally based on a single questionnaire by the German survey published by Hansson (1988:20-21; 1991:76-77, 84-85), which is known for having sometimes made big claims based on almost no data (such as is the case with Pongyong). Due to such scanty data, Hansson himself hedged to say that Pongyong may be a part of Saam [raq] (Hansson 1988:20-21; Hansson 1991:61, 85). I have not yet found any Kirati language scholars that have heard of Pongyong suggested as a unique language (outside of Hansson\'s work) or of Pongyong claimed by anyone as their own language. There is also little documentation (albeit some) about Saam, so there does not seem to be enough evidence to merge these ISO code elements. It seems that the Pongyong code element should be eliminated from ISO 639-3 or at grouped together as a part of Saam [raq] if for some reason that is necessary. I think eliminating the [pgy] code element makes the most sense.'},

The majority of the Ethnologue/ISO names are, however, dialect names.\nThe \u201clanguages\u201d to be merged are in fact dialects or dialect groups within a single language. All historical linguists who work on Mayan agree on almost all of the actual languages in terms of identity (there is some disagreement about how the family is ramified), and agree that there are many fewer than are listed in Ethnologue or by ISO. The ISO codes taken from Ethnologue represent some of the dialects of different Mayan languages, but are not even a complete or accurate listing of dialects. At any rate, the distinctions they make need to be made at the level of dialect designations or codes, not language codes. If for some reason it is decided to maintain dialect distinctions in the codes for Mayan languages instead of merging the separate codes, then each language needs a separate general code to designate the language as a whole rather than one of its dialects. The languages about which there is still some discussion are: Achi (most linguists agree that it is a dialect (group) of K\u2019ichee\u2019, but speakers have chosen overwhelmingly to identify it as a separate language), Cholti\u2019 (separate extinct language or ancestral language?), Motozintlec and Tuzantec (dialects of Mocho\u2019 or separate languages?). The classification originally made by Terrence Kaufman and supported by the work of Lyle Campbell is that which is generally accepted, while the classification made by John Robertson is in agreement on most of the language names but disagrees on some of the family divisions.

It was included in the Zorc dissertation/monograph on Bisayan languages, but overlooked by all other researchers afterwards (but will be included in the forthcoming Lobel dissertation, where it is treated a distinct language). Zorc\'s dissertation treats Tandaganon as coordinate with Surigaonon, as does the forthcoming Lobel dissertation. Native speakers of this language refer to it as "Tandaganon" or "Tagon-on" and not as Surigaonon. It is different enough from Surigaonon that Surigaonon speakers refer to it as "Kamayo" (which is the next language to the south of Tandaganon); On the other hand, it is different enough from Kamayo that Kamayo speakers refer to it as "Tandaganon", "Tagon- on", or "Surigaonon". Tandaganon speakers often have intelligibility of Surigaonon because Surigaonon speakers from northern Surigao del Sur often come to Tandag (the provincial capitol) in order to conduct business. Surigaonon speakers (and especially those from outside of Surigao del Sur province) have much less understanding of Tandaganon, and as previously stated, often mistakenly refer to it as "Kamayo", a language which is even more different from Surigaonon.'},

     'comment': u'request by Brian Paris\n\nThe Tangga language is said to be spoken in three different locations; the Tangga Islands, the Feni Islands, and mainland New Ireland, PNG. A 2005 survey conducted by SIL-PNG showed that the three varieties spoken in the three locations consider themselves distinct, though sharing a common history. Even though all three groups say there was a time when they all spoke the same language, now they no longer understand each other. (Please note the accompanying survey report is a draft.)\nThis is shown through a lexicostatistic comparison, where Fanamaket scores an average of 69 with Warwar Feni, highest is a 70, and an average of 69 with Niwer Mil, highest a 69 (see pages 16 and 17 of the accompanying survey report).\nThis is verified by the reported comprehension between the varieties. Speakers of Warwar Feni and Niwer Mil said that children understand very little or nothing of the Fanamaket variety, while speakers of Fanamaket said the same of the other two varieties. (19 and 20).\nThe lexicostatistic comparison between Warwar Feni and Niwer Mil showed an average score of 83, the highest being 84 (pages 16-17).\nThe reported comprehension between the varieties is stark. Respondents in two Niwer Mil villages reported that children can understand nothing of Warwar Feni, while respondents in the other two Niwer Mil villages reported that children can understand little of Warwar Feni. On the other side, respondents in three Warwar Feni villages reported that children can understand nothing of Niwer Mil while the other two villages reported children can understand only a little. (pages 19 and 20)\nWhen asked specifically about the acceptance of language development in the other varieties, each said they would refuse to use them. Each group wants language development in their own variety. (page 22)\n"People from the Tanga Islands, Feni Islands, and the three New Ireland villages perceive themselves to be speaking different languages. They recognise that the three languages are related and they report that they have a shared origin on New Ireland, but speakers of any one dialect do not think that the other two dialects sound good, they do not think that the other two dialects are very comprehensible, and they generally say they would not be willing to use literature in either of the other two dialects. People from each group would prefer to use literature in their own dialect. Even if Warwar Feni speakers could understand literature in the Niwer Mil dialect, they probably would not use Niwer Mil materials. Therefore, Niwer Mil and Warwar Feni speakers should not be grouped together to use the same literature.\nIn conclusion, for the purposes of language development, Niwer Mil, Warwar Feni, and Fanamaket can be considered different languages and should each have their own literature."

     'comment': u'request by Barb Waugh\n\nEthnologue data on Takpa_tkk is slim - it is spoken in Tibet on the India border and is classified as Tibetan, Western, Ladakhi. Researching the bibliographical references given for the [tkk] entry (Shafer, Hale, Benedict, Voegelin), leads to the conclusion that this is an alternate name for [twm], for which there is already an entry in China.\nShafer\'s study was on "Dwags", which according to Michailovsky, is spoken in the areas of Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh,Tshona in Southern Tibet, and in neighboring parts of Bhutan. He classified it as East Bodish. The other three sources have no information other than a language called Takpa that has been classified as Bodish (Benedict) or a central dialect of Tibetan (Voegelin). Hale gives a comparison of the above classifications along with those of Roerich, who called it an eastern or southeastern dialect of Tibetan and Nishida, who called it a southeastern dialect of Tibetan.\nIt appears that the original data and language name of Dakpa, or Dwags, came from Hodgon (1853) which was then published and used in analysis by Shafer (1954). (See Michael Aris (1980) as quoted in Bielmeier (2004)): "The term Dag-pa .. is applied by the Bhutanese to a small group of pastoralists on the eastern border who are related to the Mon-pa people of the rTawang region ... Hodgson\'s informant in the mid-19th century was undoubtedly a native of the area."\nTakpa and Dwags are listed in Ethnologue as alternate names for Tawang Monpa [twm] in India.\nBurling (2003) says that Takpa (Dwags) is spoken in the very western tip of Arunachal, where it is referred to as \'Northern Monpa\'... also spoken in Tibet where it is known as \'cuona monpa\'.\nMichailovsky and Mazaudon (1994) states that: "The closest relative of the Bumthang group on which studies have been published is probably the Dakpa language spoken in the areas of Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh and Tshona (Cuona) in southern Tibet, and in neighboring parts of Bhutan.\nI can find no data in the Takpa [tkk] references in the Ethnologue to support its classification as Tibetan, Western, Ladakhi. On the contrary, Dakpa has been grouped with East Bodish by Shafer, Burling, van Driem and Michailovsky & Mazaudon. Cuona Monpa (which is the name in China for [twm]) is classified as East Bodish by Bradley. The [twm] entry in the Ethnologue is currently listed as Tibetan, Unclassified. I propose to assign to it the classification of Sino-Tibetan, Tibeto-Burman, Himalayish, Tibeto-Kanauri, Tibetic, Tibetan, Eastern.'},

     'comment': u'request by David Mead\n\nGrimes and Grimes (1987) Languages of South Sulawesi, proposed two languages to the east of the Toraja area: Toala\' and Rongkong. Even though the Grimeses\' own computations showed Toala\' and Rongkong to be 83% cognate, one consideration for not combining the languages was that Rongkong speakers themselves viewed their language as separate. However, a follow-up survey of the Toraja language area (Valkama 1987, WILC vol. 5) revealed dialect chaining which was more complex than the Grimeses\' initial survey had indicated, with no particular reason to demark the two languages. In their update to Languages of South Sulawesi, Tim Friberg and Tom Laskowske (1989, NUSA vol. 31) proposed that these two languages be combined and be renamed the Rongkong- Luwu\' language.\nIn 1988, Ian and Tanya Vail began living in the area, in order to investigate the situation in greater detail. After an extensive survey, which involved living in six different locations in Kabupaten Luwu, Vail concurred (Vail 1991) that the languages be combined, but suggested that the language be named Tae\' after the negative term which is used throughout the area (this term was also acceptable to speakers themselves as a language name). However, this term is neither definitive nor unambiguous, since tae\'is also the negative term in Sa\'dan Toraja (compare for example Van der Veen\'s 1940 Tae\' Woordenboek, which is a dictionary of Sa\'dan Toraja, not Rongkong-Luwu\').\nUnfortunately, these later suggestions were only halfway incorporated into the Ethnologue, which up through the 14th and 15th editions, had changed the name of Rongkong to Tae\' but maintained Toala\' as a separate language. The data listed under Tae\' (location, dialects, etc.) in the Ethnologue, 14th and 15th eds., partly assume that the languages were merged, and yet partly assume that the languages are separate.\nOne curiosity is where Chuck and Barbara Grimes even got the name Toala\'. They write on page 49, "There has been great diversity in the previous classification of Toala\'..." and so one might assume from the following discussion that Esser, Van der Veen, Salzner, Mills and the authors of the Peta Bahasa had all mentioned a Toala\' language, but this is not true. The term Toala\' is used only by Salzner, who listed it under his Makasar-Bugi group (see page 15), but never gave it a location on his Southern Sulawesi map (map no. 23). Since Salzner did not do any original research in Sulawesi, he must have picked up this term from someone else, but we could not track down this earlier source. Noorduyn calls Toala\' "an exceedingly inapt exonym ... meaning \'people of the forest\'" (1991:203). The preferred self-designation is Luwu\', and "there is little chance of confusion with the Luwu dialect of Bugis" (Friberg and Laskowske 1989:9).\nFollowing Vail (1991), there are four dialects of Tae\'. Major subdialects of Tae\' appear to be:\n- Northeast Luwu\' (= Bone-bone = Masamba) \n- Rongkong\n= Seko Lemo\n= Rongkong Atas\n= Rongkong Bawah (= Sabbang)\n- Bua\n- South Luwu\'\n= Bajo (=Palili\') \n= Bastem (=Toala\')\n\nHowever, integrating the dialect descriptions of Valkama (1987:125, 127), Friberg and Laskowske (1989:9) and Vail (1991:79) is not without its difficulties. In particular, Valkama writes as if Rongkong Bawah and Sabbang are separate subdialects, and places the latter within his North Luwu dialect. Valkama also uses the inelegant terms Northern South Luwu\' and Southern South Luwu\'. These terms are especially to be avoided since once Bua is removed from his Northern South Luwu\' (following Vail 1991), the split is more east- west rather than north-south. The Bastem and Bajo subdialects are named after kecamatans (subdistricts), but both are spoken more broadly than the respective kecamatan borders. Bastem is a mountain kecamatan which borders on the Toraja area. Finally, it is unclear from Ian Vail\'s report whether Bone-bone and Masamba are to be regarded as synonyms for Northeast Luwu\', or whether they should be regarded as separate, marginally different subdialects under Northeast Luwu\'. Kari Valkama took only one word list in this area, so it is impossible to resolve the issue by investigating Kari\'s primary data.'},

     'comment': u'request by Anthony Aristar, head of the MultiTree Team\n\nUnggumi and Worrorra have been considered separate languages for some time now. In McGregor\'s 1988 Worrorran classification in his "Handbook of Kimberley Languages," he lists them both as separate languages. In 2009, McGregor and Alan Rumsey also list both Unggumi and Worrorra as independent languages within the Western Worrorran group (7).\nThe Australian Phylum classification by O\'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin also treats Unggumi and Worrorra as separate languages (1966: 35). They explain that "the primary verbal distinction is between realis and irrealis in all languages in the Wororan family (except Worora, which distinguishes many moods and tenses)" (1966: 79). Presumably this further sets Worora apart from Unggumi.\nBoth languages are listed independently in AUSTLANG, with Unggumi given the AIATSIS code K14 and Worrorra given the separate code K17.

     'comment': u'request by Dr Alexandre FRANC\u0327OIS\n\nVera\'a and Lemerig belong historically to two distinct language communities, even though Lemerig speakers now have generally adopted Vera\'a as their primary language. There is low intelligibility between Vera\'a and Lemerig.\n"Vatrata" is not, and never was, used by the local community. It was chosen by XIXth-c. missionaries based on another language (Mota). The speakers designate their village and language as Vera\'a (apostrophe = glottal stop). This is also the spelling which I have adopted in my scientific work, and which has been used by other scholars ever since. "Vatrata" is used by nobody else than Codrington (1885). As for "Vetrat", it is the name of the place & language, in the dominant language of Vanua Lava (Vure\u0308s [msn]).\nThe dialect names "Leon, Pak, Sasar" as listed in the Ethnologue form part of the distinct language called Lemerig.\nThere is no body of literature either in or on either of these languages, no other reason to keep the 2 languages under a single code.\nVera\'a should be considered the main language of the two, because it is viable and spoken by more speakers (about 300); Lemerig is dying out, with only 2 speakers.\nImportant note: the three dialects currently mentioned under "Vatrata", namely "Leon, Pak (Bek) and Sasar", correspond in fact to various ancient varieties of the language Lemerig. As far as I know, all these dialects became extinct during the last generation, except for Pak (or more precisely Pa\u0308k) which still has 2 speakers alive. Everybody insist that these three names, all corresponding to small mountain hamlets now deserted, should be placed under the umbrella term "LEMERIG" to designate the language.\nFinally, Vatrata has no internal dialect.'},

     'comment': u"request by Lewis C. Lawyer\n\nModern scholars of Wintuan languages are in agreement that Wintu, Nomlaki and Patwin are three separate languages. The most thorough discussion of the language and dialect situation in all three of the Wintuan languages is in Whistler's (1980) dissertation (pp. 15\u2013 30, 46\u201353). Shepherd's (2005) book on Proto-Wintuan also distinguishes these three languages (see esp. pp. 1\u20134). Other more general works in agreement are: Golla (2011, 140\u2013147), Mithun (1999, 560\u2013563), and Campbell (1997, 128). The discussion in Golla (2011) of the dialect continuum between Wintu and Nomlaki should by no means rule out their being recognized as two distinct languages. Dialect continuums are not uncommon in geographically adjacent languages which are closely related. Authors of ethnographies, grammars, dictionaries and collections of texts are careful to distinguish the three groups both ethnographically and linguistically: cf. for Patwin, Kroeber (1932) and Whistler (1977, 1978); for Nomlaki, Goldschmidt (1951); and for Wintu, Shepherd (1989), Pitkin (1984, 1985), and Schlichter (1981)."},

     'comment': u'request by Anthony Aristar, head of the MultiTree Team\n\nNauo, also known as Nawo, is a poorly attested, but clearly separate language from Wirangu (ISO 639-3: wiw). Ethnologue 16 currently lists "Nhawu" as an alternate name of Wirangu, but this name actually refers to this separate language Nauo. Hercus and Simpson investigated the little that is known about Nauo in their article "The Tragedy of Nauo," arguing that "the Nauo people were part of a chain of culturally related groups living on Eyre Peninsula and along the west coast, and that their language had elements in common with both Wirangu and Barngarla" (2001: 263).\nHercus and Simpson also argue that Wirangu is not a dialect of the Western Desert language, but is in fact a member of the Thura-Yura subgroup (2004). Hercus and Simpson systematically show that Nauo is a Thura-Yura language in their 2001 article, demonstrating that it has some qualities that are similar to Wirangu and others that are similar to Barnggarla (ISO 639-3: bjb). They explain that "phonotactically, it resembles Wirangu, rather than Barngarla, in allowing initial \'ty(i)\' , and \'i-u\' sequences. Three distinctive Nauo properties are the morphemes \'-yu\' and \'-lye\', and the final vowel of the second person singular, \'niino\'. Finally, Schu\u0308rmann\'s observation that Nauo was vowel-final is important: this links it with Barngarla and distinguishes it from Wirangu, Mirniny, and Kukata" (2001: 279).\nAs far back as 1966, O\'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin included Nawu in their Yura subgroup (40). Wirangu was included in a separate subgroup called Nangga (1966: 40). More recently, Tryon has classified both Wirangu and what he calls Nawu as Thura-Yura languages (2007: 117).\nAUSTLANG follows both Hercus and Simpson 2001 and 2004 and places both Wirangu and Nauo in the Thura-Yura subgroup of the Pama-Nyungan family (2011).\nIt should also be noted that Hercus and Simpson 2004 identified two dialects of Wirangu, Modern Wirangu and Gawler Ranges Wirangu (181, 182-183).'},

     'comment': u'request by Nora C. England\n\nThe name is a dialect or dialect group name, and therefore incorrect for a language designation. It should be changed to the general language name. There is almost no disagreement among linguists about what the general language names for Mayan languages are. The majority of the Ethnologue/ISO names are, however, dialect names.\nThe \u201clanguages\u201d to be merged are in fact dialects or dialect groups within a single language. All historical linguists who work on Mayan agree on almost all of the actual languages in terms of identity (there is some disagreement about how the family is ramified), and agree that there are many fewer than are listed in Ethnologue or by ISO. The ISO codes taken from Ethnologue represent some of the dialects of different Mayan languages, but are not even a complete or accurate listing of dialects. At any rate, the distinctions they make need to be made at the level of dialect designations or codes, not language codes. If for some reason it is decided to maintain dialect distinctions in the codes for Mayan languages instead of merging the separate codes, then each language needs a separate general code to designate the language as a whole rather than one of its dialects. The languages about which there is still some discussion are: Achi (most linguists agree that it is a dialect (group) of K\u2019ichee\u2019, but speakers have chosen overwhelmingly to identify it as a separate language), Cholti\u2019 (separate extinct language or ancestral language?), Motozintlec and Tuzantec (dialects of Mocho\u2019 or separate languages?). The classification originally made by Terrence Kaufman and supported by the work of Lyle Campbell is that which is generally accepted, while the classification made by John Robertson is in agreement on most of the language names but disagrees on some of the family divisions. The list of currently accepted names of Mayan languages, arranged according to the family divisions and branches proposed by Kaufman, follows. I am using Mayan spelling for the Guatemalan languages, since there is general agreement among speakers of these languages to use these spellings. Language names are preceded by a hyphen.\nHuastecan division: -Huastec, -Chicomuceltec (extinct) Yucatecan division: -Yucatec Maya, -Lacandon, -Itzaj, -Mopan\nWestern division, Greater Tzeltalan branch, Cholan: -Ch\u2019olti\u2019 (ancestral form of Ch\u2019orti\u2019 or extinct lg?), -Ch\u2019orti\u2019, -Chol, -Chontal\nWestern division, Greater Tzeltalan branch, Tzeltalan: -Tzotzil, -Tzeltal Western division, Greater Q\u2019anjob\u2019alan branch, Chujean: -Tojolab\u2019al, -Chuj\nWestern division, Greater Q\u2019anjob\u2019alan branch, Q\u2019anjob\u2019alan Proper, Q\u2019anjob\u2019al complex: -Q\u2019anjob\u2019al, -Akateko, -Popti\u2019 (Jakalteko)\nWestern division, Greater Q\u2019anjob\u2019alan branch, Cotoque complex (2 languages or 2 dialects?): -Mocho\u2019 (Motozintleco, Tuzanteco)\nEastern division, Greater Mamean branch, Mamean Proper: -Teko, -Mam Eastern division, Greater Mamean branch, Ixilan: -Awakateko, -Ixil Eastern division, Greater K\u2019ichee\u2019an branch: -Uspanteko\nEastern division, Greater K\u2019ichee\u2019an branch, K\u2019ichee\u2019an Proper: -Sipakapense, -Sakapulteko, -K\u2019ichee\u2019, -Achi (also considered a dialect group within K\u2019ichee\u2019), -Tz\u2019utujiil, -Kaqchikel\nEastern division, Greater K\u2019ichee\u2019an branch, Poqom: -Poqomam, -Poqomchi\u2019 Eastern division, Greater K\u2019ichee\u2019an branch:-Q\u2019eqchi\u2019'}
